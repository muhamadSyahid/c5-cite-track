Case Studies of Hospital Pharmacy Automation in Canada and France","paperAbstract":"Automated medication dispensing systems for hospital pharmacies, heralded as an important means of reducing drug errors and improving labor productivity, have also been seen as a means of furthering the transformation of the pharmacy profession from its role in dispensing prescriptions to a clinical profession concerned with treatments and patient outcomes. Automation aids this transformation by transferring the responsibility for routine dispensing to technicians performing rationalized and computer-mediated tasks. Not all pharmacists agree with these trends. Some fear a loss of professional status and employment as their knowledge is expropriated and incorporated into machinery operated by those with lesser qualifications. They fear an industrial rather than a clinical future. Their concerns are compounded by health care cutbacks. These issues were studied at two hospitals in Canada and one in France, all mid-sized public hospitals with automated unit dose drug delivery systems installed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Preliminary results indicated national differences in approaches to hospital pharmacy automation. In Canada, pharmacists have resisted major changes in their control of the dispensing process and in their traditional roles vis \u00e0 vis doctors and pharmacy technicians. In France, where hospital pharmacy as a profession is less developed than in North America, automation has brought about a far more radical substitution for pharmacists' labor.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/062e9c7579adc73129e1198671d05905f07d4ab5","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"J  Novek","ids":["47586327"]}],"inCitations":["bd83b3183a024806f957b381dea83cb54d639c63","59a8feb7cfbc50c64152b116dba1dad3412cd104","663b3c9bbc9a1309d636044e50347e177da74624","d971ec3ac906e2eeeb55085e7981dd00f0d89ea3","c99841c4b20d932557c88807bcb5ade30c7015f3","e8212e6887515d942e2718623a55017c9586513a","799bde07f3e9dc7f39d30ae9e1ac29cda9cd5a5c","4b1262fe3464cde84e4cb5f5d2ae65ae32042485","df39365a156ea828184c359348f78811c673c553","23d2cdbc256deb8e00e829c3a92cf7b7dc9f9f52"],"outCitations":["1723e0346fc1de5bb835c71c66388c1c128a1abe","e121fb377bf9f4e8c2a864ee66e6e68b7c229366","a402dac75befed8c389fe00a3b6eed7ee8da87e1","26481340135fb307993adf54a8dec878143a8a00","7d98fde2bdb4e879c1f578e4cdb4d0c8e0334783","e199c5f0fb793b7d9bb1498f8d095524a2e86a81","5e266d4c50630b20a4bcbbceac7ead5b2b8e4a51","c33122bc4d2780bf1a42160efda2c97f65643b19","2a012d8f4630cd0bac2e038cf9cb20f65fc9d0c6","0ac259672357b2a6aa35bdea62e4781c3bd49976","4a26d06a38680498895fa9b7a1b2004c2484673c","39ae41005ac4a91a43d8e73fdaf42ddc97a050ef","eac59ad6377028dce6bf0604610be969c65bd516","f399655322b17d31515178050779a6d6f0a4ad68","598853073d646f9d86124dd804294163e4dc6c6f","90c7289240281ed7300d7a3a5d8916674be28100","c641b685483c831578dc4cb12e9ff9a68e9751e3","9d345ea1f94c8d01f46afcc4e9238e647029489c","94e54a72e5d8c736d6ca41becf85bda51a527a35","ee6e9bd43376f72aeaec5496b8fe7dadfe6a57ad","90241d37be4b06dd9b2f4ee4cf8de9089d7ea9ce","ddc676ecdf1784c5241f5afb2947c980609568c5"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":1998,"venue":"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation","journalName":"International Journal of Health Services","journalVolume":"28","journalPages":"445 - 465","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.2190\/W2BT-FGXQ-QL0G-YNL9","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2190\/W2BT-FGXQ-QL0G-YNL9","pmid":"9711475","magId":"1988383910"}

High-resolution, noninvasive MRI may provide exhaustive 3-D anatomic information about the lumen and the vessel wall. Furthermore, MRI has the ability to characterize plaque composition and microanatomy and therefore to identify lesions vulnerable to rupture or erosion. The high resolution of MRI and the development of sophisticated contrast agents offer the promise of molecular in vivo molecular imaging of the plaque. This may aid early intervention (e.g., lipid lowering drug regiments) in both primary and secondary treatment of vascular disease in all arterial beds.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/771723e7e2d9ed97d09442086553b726f0dd6657","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Zahi A Fayad","ids":["1886137"]}],"inCitations":["888b53d3e7b9f34eb1b5f28bdfc29b6cb964dfa6","8361c59ea60f731f82612950578a91f78d63cb1f","95ada4c028cc26ae3e65c8df7e1673280e10776c","8f4b0b73da2a16d4e33ac983b2d4e070a9344c4c","a69647f5cfd044c30c6e09bef77bc53acf2668d5","1b70c9716987be8a6f90656d09af9f2dd0e51806","1b595ab60dbdaad1a7096859340bb515eb5d2476","6db0cdc19fb91418d1d9a9c4ee2d69e0dc9fd780","362ff0ad46be3b71ee9c14e346f6d6619e6f3736","ba2cbbac306fa374c7c07da398e31a52c5680a58","0de4efab5980b5245d979d4efa21c93c49741c5e","7163fd23cca22909409c5cb1761a33ef6dde9aab","0a304f91ce7467c6a0e61d4de0cd1f3028d3fedf","becc01c8ef3e0d8a0d98c6071c797514a84c6e67","4b1721e5d97f5069d81f7b0747b8ec5f82606770","4945698b16a7ce9c9b9ad3219595a04b3de240ca"],"outCitations":["1aa5f64bbe1d0c4c74fc3de7c89ac2dffb48630a","99be2761648ca99121455d4b17cc5cfe506c5e59","3659e3fb2a308c603b276680bf67134007f17716","44b703b8f29dcd3dfb5e61cec08004f8bacb7eee","fad3db7a83b87e2c37d0c69c8997f16c28dbfb11","9f5b0397dab0a7394e4ffba062d9250bd8ba77ed","8462f4b6590713db112d6fc665b43cfeb88bab41","7cfcefc3d48cbe1a5af83fc2edb1fbcf12aa8f67","35037881facb496e464fad38f251df592a4b592e","d6a8f6cc558225fb2c241e2781dbecc499037bb1","47af1c2bfd5f65dad41dd64a8ef1618aabcaa233","aeaf7df8edc8205b65b7054cd15e746d961670a6","0e0b8f87b8c4e5781d166949d06024ada09a0649","ff86f9fb81cb70a28ad12a5ef3847d1825550869","3109764f646de80e096609f86b5e4bf19320c81c","67c4be094bfa7d1d1c37a96552ab8aea97922dc3","23dede3691a43c17ae54cf986dfb5c3e514d3312","5ca8fb9f3b4ec70541e1db170b5e7b27e604f251","fd1e77daf64f7c9e45108d6ef527f69165421d13","505e20ad29ef487e70271b56e0789f53fa66555c","ce6185fcbd64726b7cb7cc5d4c0527927452ee27","7535f12b45e635c7ee18e82eaf263a2ad5528078","c50a0d16bbff76208d2d62c8b08f1a53e622bfb5","4bcb840bd53ccd4176bd655cedbb77f62cf394c5","988766703f41f4ee9f0ba280c875349c56d212d5","c7fde4bd952c140e5f213383fb08ed505e0639e5","8ee6e00e28646b93f25d20006a8fd3fa588f5d31","ecda4d12ebbaaecc03e68c56b900e8862a04a357","f9d2fdadd49b95c0dc2fc6972ecebe5759033ca0","c09cc1f083544f797080a4f9720e7f0a12a5151e","2a078c6cd5b1e84d143110a5f631dd8d6c0963bf","5dbd1317f762f235880a921d453a3e62224835f8","06e968fe14e4b10f324051b838dddcd681c54f8a","84fb8e0ceeea2b5da19ef562a4dca373961c552b","03784022d5621b9e83f3814ba7676809d91e349d","7ced55d9d3fa00d5bb010d234b545125ba469de7","ef8cd11edb3ad918ee193f880d4430a178c493cb","3166173e2467d1d8f03a0113ad513d7269cc8106","c5fbca3ff0c967316736c0714352317e5cf1c5e6","5e76b40c3b648d9c370be840c379815ac01e5125","f9898e4d2a5d43f881669bfcd91f1c177f9fe2f1","1e077c424ff10900a990c81c846fadf84303a06d","95e032f4525217a5d13c8e5520957e43d8c7a422","584dd4beda9bd9b6944506e132ccd11b0e93327f","e3718ee0bafe60b684e71e72345ce0064cb5046e","5fd4c72a933c953eaab3de7f527aeab109250f58","f2fa93e36b2eb43340af7f61a6534097b15769a4","a8b03025b7fefa59d5debe2a5e7861dffe65fabc","fbc8f39f23e543894a8bc3f78195da5393e0bdef","5c5cc8632b16a2384b44e5abf2e05ba98eca2f77","be5a95ed86533245e807ad6e9028e6959a5c1362","4612485fc46102f9c0b8ed0889ff95a4ac5ade92","c2f90cc3beaeccb9b58f9b56559eb3cfecce324f","11fd0e6933f3191fdad8f009f9b2406ae8a56fbc","918f05ee72661357217ecdd816aa688d966793b0","873239030e5f09f538aa92ffd2123b46e1cee3fe","c050b7473a14d5330f054481827cee5974caf023","92b3b79856d91e9954b1a6609b7dba57b0bdf1b6","7e1a3b3dfd3a44d345ff7cb0b8f87e2a7b6a969b","8dc8c738be229d6c120355c59cbdb532118a1c1f","9aa0bc0cedd64387bc6cbec2c35eb086633b88e2","fc7ebd24bded56f3d3dc655267f17940367a388b","e774d9cc34c4b02200f3be7be833baeb0450e2f7","41345f1f9493868da7cdc80a5c41503cc6db0cfa","3a07885d39ad19602f42d2e3a7905040d68e5918","790b29389fc72d3ca6965b25b74ca66cb2da74b1"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2002,"venue":"Neuroimaging clinics of North America","journalName":"Neuroimaging clinics of North America","journalVolume":"12 3","journalPages":"\n          461-71\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1016\/S1052-5149(02)00023-0","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/S1052-5149%2802%2900023-0","pmid":"12486833","magId":"1983175018"}

Computation of the clinical morphometric parameters requires the segmentation of endothelial cell images. Current techniques to image the endothelium in vivo deliver low quality images, which makes automatic segmentation a complicated task. Here, we present two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to segment CE images: a global fully convolutional approach based on U-net, and a local sliding-window network (SW-net). We propose to use probabilistic labels instead of binary, we evaluate a preprocessing method to enhance the contrast of images, and we introduce a postprocessing method based on Fourier analysis and watershed to convert the CNN output images into the final cell segmentation. Both methods are applied to 50 images acquired with an SP-1P Topcon specular microscope. Estimates are compared against a manual delineation made by a trained observer.ResultsU-net (AUC=0.9938) yields slightly sharper, clearer images than SW-net (AUC=0.9921). After postprocessing, U-net obtains a DICE=0.981 and a MHD=0.22 (modified Hausdorff distance), whereas SW-net yields a DICE=0.978 and a MHD=0.30. U-net generates a wrong cell segmentation in only 0.48% of the cells, versus 0.92% for the SW-net. U-net achieves statistically significant better precision and accuracy than both, Topcon and SW-net, for the estimates of three clinical parameters: cell density (ECD), polymegethism (CV), and pleomorphism (HEX). The mean relative error in U-net for the parameters is 0.4% in ECD, 2.8% in CV, and 1.3% in HEX. The computation time to segment an image and estimate the parameters is barely a few seconds.ConclusionsBoth methods presented here provide a statistically significant improvement over the state of the art. U-net has reached the smallest error rate. We suggest a segmentation refinement based on our previous work to further improve the performance.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/984774e366d3d4fcf0fce659f697478dccd4f93c","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/bmcbiomedeng.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/s42490-019-0003-2"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Juan P.

{"id":"0d0467c4cccb0dcf0a30589a1d3dddd2cecfda11","title":"Technologies for Detecting Falsified and Substandard Drugs in Low and Middle-Income Countries","paperAbstract":"Falsified and substandard drugs are a global health problem, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) that have weak pharmacovigilance and drug regulatory systems. Poor quality medicines have important health consequences, including the potential for treatment failure, development of antimicrobial resistance, and serious adverse drug reactions, increasing healthcare costs and undermining the public's confidence in healthcare systems. This article presents a review of the methods employed for the analysis of pharmaceutical formulations. Technologies for detecting substandard and falsified drugs were identified primarily through literature reviews. Key-informant interviews with experts augmented our methods when warranted. In order to aid comparisons, technologies were assigned a suitability score for use in LMIC ranging from 0\u20138. Scores measured the need for electricity, need for sample preparation, need for reagents, portability, level of training required, and speed of analysis. Technologies with higher scores were deemed the most feasible in LMICs. We categorized technologies that cost $10,000 USD or less as low cost, $10,000\u2013100,000 USD as medium cost and those greater than $100,000 USD as high cost technologies (all prices are 2013 USD). This search strategy yielded information on 42 unique technologies. Five technologies were deemed both low cost and had feasibility scores between 6\u20138, and an additional four technologies had medium cost and high feasibility. Twelve technologies were deemed portable and therefore could be used in the field. Many technologies can aid in the detection of substandard and falsified drugs that vary from the simplest of checklists for packaging to the most complex mass spectrometry analyses. Although there is no single technology that can serve all the requirements of detecting falsified and substandard drugs, there is an opportunity to bifurcate the technologies into specific niches to address specific sections within the workflow process of detecting products.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/0d0467c4cccb0dcf0a30589a1d3dddd2cecfda11","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0090601&type=printable","http:\/\/ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pub\/pmc\/7a\/35\/pone.0090601.PMC3966738.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Stephanie  Kovacs","ids":["48299217"]},{"name":"Stephen E.

{"id":"237e5a3778ccff06cd2d3e2d3f76eddf82913a7b","title":"Effects of annealing temperature on the structure and static magnetic properties of NiZnCo ferrite thin films","paperAbstract":"Abstract The Ni 0.22 Zn 0.52 Co 0.03 Fe 2.23 O 4 ferrite thin films are deposited on Si (100) substrate by a radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method. The structure and magnetic properties of NiZnCo ferrite thin films with different annealing temperatures (600\u00a0\u00b0C, 700\u00a0\u00b0C, 800\u00a0\u00b0C and 900\u00a0\u00b0C) have been investigated. The secondary impurity phases of Fe 2 O 3 and ZnO slowly disappeared with annealing temperature up to 800\u00a0\u00b0C. But, there are some FeSiO 3 , Zn 2 SiO 4 and SiO 2 impurity phases formation when the annealing temperature is 900\u00a0\u00b0C. The average grain size and surface roughness increased with annealing temperature up to 800\u00a0\u00b0C and then they decreased at 900\u00a0\u00b0C. The saturation magnetization gradually increases with annealing temperature up to 800\u00a0\u00b0C and then it decreases at 900\u00a0\u00b0C.

Methods We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes. Results Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10\/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes. Conclusions We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/878a852598fbb063b71485edf9620d0aeef6eced","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Wei-Hsiu  Liu","ids":["46641658"]},{"name":"Pi-Yueh  Chang","ids":["34639680"]},{"name":"Shih-Cheng  Chang","ids":["2843302"]},{"name":"Jang-Jih  Lu","ids":["3603308"]},{"name":"Che-Ming  Wu","ids":["7513502"]}],"inCitations":["7969daceda733427664c2ccf338d6440226ebe21","25e34e2ee7731d1b34f8814ad70e42e08db4a117","52be7c3d8102bd6a735aafb8005d6fbfc5da3574","166d85405fb4a951d7c23203cc72832a7d9908ce","4e8ce82cfc5666b6467398ac5733cdb0363083f1"],"outCitations":["e60b0d9f1acf02185ecd9f7b0f8650fe087f1f43","96a4f6d42667182efeee9be783784e65f870cf3f","b65adac93228edf93315a3a21afbe1d9623ecdfd","b85f9bce1609971bea39df438067b4e4bb45be9d","efb49391f64ca5e5d5f3ba6a9e812dab3e10e87b","a77eb24170a610eadaa39f96ad2195ea55bbd25b","df137ecc497ac19475831bf44e3166af8b6e453f","b858ce153876d8cfeb30968e8a1bfb82e9fa3cda","a7dbf9168b16ca1de3a1dc8294bd162514ff794b","f2fec74b3fcf04509842ba904462469575a4ba6f","71243a2d50e13533ae9b7b1441175bcf655ead38","8a4a0663c51c1f4393e2d9bf8e16afc42405db47","fff32970c4a2cb9366106eee78fbdbefe009115e","fc01441847530cbb37466038afc6315cb8b98b0c","16e7df5c5c0cfb6d57b92325fe3c3f47909ad9e3","0eb81e6dd45f63077f144f530de8a05ba8333362","5bc9107f248b6a82d48dc2a48e66af97dd7805d8","b4531bc5930b299d16946b82edfa0352ac6bf5cf","13124e0018f2d05d6edab66bf39f4e33d0287081","40af773c4ab748f2543af9c103d2ec053874e236","7b54b9311b25a87eeea7788c97fb4a8df9391799","96bec34ec2a42729f9801642c3190b2b60112c50","a7b63b68d4c7d369a6a47abb05b07d99825ac4a4","da26c00c5997e457e0cabe5d4492ca65fc85a68b","23ca99cc5b24ff959e195879413fdf66f26e8373","0687297655b8e4e689435aa1c76026d4beb22079","cc5b6e9ec0e000b83da9ab81d4f377feebee6e9c","481501d89fa2c567c745e413a6302842f11ba545","8bb39c87d5c3afa99eae82b0668d4a3b2af4af6f","224a71dccc1fafdd5bb15678de42415903b0e7bb","a196d3969a8a677ef219f57ac93ef29f0d1be400","2965fb4f3970e3e8e689b19506da95c7bf49b7f4","5bd6f6d21b7aebe75a4c3bb9c77df7725a115cf8","9d1fc4e31f59310e48532932f6ddea424b3ec986","af5a33ca00a1d512c7f7fda7d098cc89e2e907aa","60d08da5e5430bbebc781e860a85e7f20cb17be0","d044567b4c1f340ebc55ab95d1a809f47d0f5416","1f44590668c66447c4b78042602035ad4d3076aa","71b240b9e05cc4bc96ab2128dc140bd955a701d1","f3c4e7be641aedad13b5457faf45d20450d40e2f","40b376fe436dd54ef6615bc9a9e6613471d2a93b","48cfae2f7066e96b80057ac52fb74d03387cee68","451973ad83949dab241f1c33aeccef33fff6b30d","04e94a74f3ab256050d6af5c13f1c050b5789b7a","1e62f5e287ef98f370abef22d49567cc8ba9567e","7943740ff1a5d71ae1347875e42cdee2813c9807","775afc1a4b001ebf8bec57defa622a5916fbcaf6","fa7a7b6c4a3fc9b8b6d3a05e33d88c3280ad268e","0fc44180fdf8ba026a36ccff0d10014eacc7f48b","07f0cb49688aee9de986444d6e5c476328b8ef31","6509e32048b95c233cca1fd9e40cb9cbcacf2bfd","5a31d355b9c844859d45947d8e4e0d0413758c67","240e6efe7866df46fa7067ef04a9e51f0c7b3c11"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2019,"venue":"PloS one","journalName":"PLoS ONE","journalVolume":"14","journalPages":"","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0211261","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0211261","pmid":"30682115","magId":"2912662639"}

The phenotype is very heterogeneous and includes polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, typically involving the facial skull, numerous caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and autonomous hyperfunctions of several endocrine systems, leading to hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, precocious puberty and acromegaly.Case presentationHere, we describe a 12-year-old Caucasian girl with severe facial involvement of fibrous dysplasia, along with massive acromegaly due to growth hormone excess and precocious puberty, with a prolactinoma. Our patient was treated with a bisphosphonate and the prolactin antagonist, cabergoline, resulting in the inhibition of fibrous dysplasia and involution of both the prolactinoma and growth hormone excess. During a follow-up of more than two years, no severe side effects were noted.ConclusionTreatment with bisphosphonates in combination with cabergoline is a suitable option in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome, especially in order to circumvent surgical interventions in patients suffering from polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involving the skull base.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/a28cf4e1bf123673c433eb1130c26d8fc51f0916","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/download-redirector.springer.com\/redirect?contentType=pdf&ddsId=art:10.1186\/1752-1947-6-32&originUrl=http:\/\/jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com\/article\/10.1186\/1752-1947-6-32","http:\/\/ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pub\/pmc\/ae\/f6\/1752-1947-6-32.PMC3277484.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Carl Friedrich Classen","ids":["4070720"]},{"name":"Monika  Mix","ids":["120452873"]},{"name":"Ulrike  Kyank","ids":["8098047"]},{"name":"Christina  Hauenstein","ids":["8599664"]},{"name":"Dieter  Haffner","ids":["145994546"]}],"inCitations":["fcd742643f1dfee53691b62fb21ebc7347402063","4261eb4dc7f89c4798987f042598c8244747b430","808aaec6bc55279da0499adec6c291118ce86aae","94efd6a878360ca77dec3439aeb1d6c7e599e29a","097c362651b6158b85629e4bd4a31a0a2d2c8916","cfb1e23adf798a2e25f157133f45ebf3797377d5","e699e87bf137b2e8eb70a4d175ea8ecff30b6de8","9156db4eabd4463add8410396fc1aaea4da36b34","9a2802c77ac618319310982cb21138d3b97b479e","e37e26ce2f32393ba6a5483eabc40a0dffe7304e","e3bb6d1bface9340919943d931a9521d0a2408ea","27dcd6d37adf20e551ebe6c338490004379b4aad","ee23f742a378c052186632f42ba07c6f52875238"],"outCitations":["75992d1f6fd419d0249343b2963f4d7528f842e2","dd5bf00ab838b8884b8a1e6fa55b12db902bc7b9","0d785d005173be366fe60a08cea8827f423b7d6f","17f5cdadb41371db2feba4167359aee010710a75","a29d8db685419e177cad1384e97023c682b82c57","f6a81b6fb1e4bcbf8dd38584a239c375749efe1d","58d562f27c5ba8b3ba9a8e001ed4d2269142d33d","cf0f3ce20ff4e7f7dbbbf0afb3fd55e5bd8dcb06","1e36bbbe286f97a2cca3e533301f7888029fb65f","46fe1083cc27a6ffe29f039e237eda236fbdaf8e","c559a0d9362913242f494e118862d3b632729ace","3f40a712c1625c765fd9766ff9e8893771fe3521","b11d34fc979cf48735503b8d8488030144c58c6d","61f02b42b1ed60179412c763ed1e10a4169d8b87"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2012,"venue":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","journalName":"Journal of Medical Case Reports","journalVolume":"6","journalPages":"32 - 32","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1186\/1752-1947-6-32","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1186\/1752-1947-6-32","pmid":"22273876","magId":"2114028698"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-fie patients with a mean age of 64.3 years (range 25-89) with 66 metastases of the humerus were surgically treated in a 7-year time-period and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer were the most abundant types of primary tumour. The mean time from diagnosis of primary tumour to fist metastasis was 14.5 months (range 0-173). The mean time from diagnosis of metastasis to surgery was 21.4 months (range 0-173). 38\/28 intramedullary nails\/locking plates were used for 58\/8 manifest\/impending pathological fractures. Mean cumulative survival was 16.3 months and implant failure rate was 6.1% with a mean time from initial surgery to revision of 22.2-20.6 months. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that treatment with intramedullary fiation or cement augmented plate osteosynthesis is successful for the vast majority of patients, but thorough clinical evaluation and precise decision making adapted to the patient's estimated life expectancy must be applied to avoid overtreatment or risk of implant failure.

Mounted on the 2.1m Viper telescope, ACBAR has dedicated four years to cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations at the South Pole. We describe the focal plane reconstruction and performance of ACBAR for the 2005 austral winter. We present a new CMB temperature anisotropy power spectrum for the complete ACBAR data set. The addition of data from the 2005 observing season expands the data set by 210%; and the sky coverage by 490%; over the previous ACBAR releases. The expanded data set allows us to derive a new set of band-power measurements with finer [italic l]-resolution and dramatically smaller uncertainties. In particular, the band-power uncertainties have been reduced by more than a factor of two on angular scales encompassing the third and fourth acoustic peaks and the damping tail of the CMB power spectrum. The calibration has been significantly improved from 6%; to 2.2%; in temperature by using a direct comparison between CMB anisotropy maps measured by WMAP3 and ACBAR to transfer the WMAP dipole-based calibration to ACBAR. The resulting power spectrum is consistent with theoretical predications for a spatially flat, dark energy-dominated Lambda CDM cosmology.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/813c51e569e807c6e1c334c436f52d06bada1030","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Christian L Reichardt","ids":["4847828"]}],"inCitations":["fb0667c714cbd5adb3a09ab95555015d7b7cc39c"],"outCitations":["83d5dc7bcbb8c20b80ce98a680ccd575fa0d0552","f1645d61dd982700a8a8cad64ad608b20030c4ca","db81d38cbee43756a0135af37990957227f64125","0ac8c62d7325ba64c803e047094193850cc1ab95","0166b37564a5f222467f218ccc32ed7266477820","bb6d8ec015dcf8d032eda3dedccda214020a4616","97a2c37ed8fd767200e3bdd2bbd999b770b4bfa4","b25048c9ca947faa8709ef0c2deee5a2643fbc13","eacbda4cd17616a67f205c44921f896c61c82462","ef7f3f64c449ee40acb8138060ee347437644dcc","a78355f775435bdc4dfb1a9f27a9f83219d593b4","0c847e700d99c916465619168fdf94bc744a1c93","e8edd10183634f2d1de3f078b9c4e00b93e8e322","aa030e8a20aac3c295afc2ea5b70b35ed6514d8e","7f6de61a31995eccec6b4084e006bc94607aa749","e275c70b5625b34581b470770f22f80e73d5a82c","bbcad639873413789d2bf2f721e2ad66539a7e94","26bc1a9cb5b3a5321cfd63c0606cf582809c0410","0a9a96949fa4267d880819418ba3f07c47767fb0","b745d88d824ee049a4bc316c371626bec46b6eb1","5afef3cbb54dae45c8cd5379e769122f757ee63b","9c3a30450ac8a772dbb774a34adf25053992a1be","c6eb3fff9c0f74b146d57ffede3d8f14d59dd53e","2396eb791e93f3d1a9f900302e9dd24e3c50e78c","55dbe2f23879602558fc097f85252bad926b32d3","a89ddf5db2b0016ea9d9e223331bfd858401ff05","d7b6e0a38b6c09e1ac2ab234f388e99aac071843","618641cd39e9bd52b8f03c650c57c0d0647ded3d","c1d0a8e9422d9a502cb211de691e46e7f17060b2","e74644dcb017fcac0df69de4d889d1dc95584d80","a47329486062632303eab9883ea9713853ffbb54","be9ef751672a78ef519341fa5728376b83d974fa","48012f7513041554a34750be347687243bbf1311","b47f975c4f273f50bf8467b2d6f20d7abf0a4cf7","4754360902dac2088484a7fc153064ca6088890f","41af8fbf945376044dbb19d95b5915ca109cff00","9a109e29fa2b6abe1dac2b09de0ba169d7273663","3a4586c5c9c3e0159d6b3368bd75157c3aed789c","9c20b774db3c85fa1c1a233e350480c793d777b8","59cac60bdb8bba4ef5bcaac18926da107fcbc956","62f3126cadacb0b8e582dcb411e29fe687da9591","e954a2773fc5946b166115610635e42691f4f409","6f1857ea76f9f6b8d760abec06fe4addc12486df","4a2474ef2a11b1fa4a6b028a6d674ae97535c782","41ac28e17b7fa2d3e6ab73b1df6fc2e355fe683a","70e1342bcf53c3c3f06e81cb39dc20d05c587fda","dbaa80a39472d601f9e7d94e6de51ed0a95a9c97","3e0ed89f76e8e15d917d791d30333bc358233e08","0704ca18b1f66ebc1020690c2160f22c28fc554b","38654f9765b198106220245a50dfc5cee7daafc3","a04f72cbcdee84a8a1f04ce5a6fed0b4804b4cab","8578774e1e2d00828fd6a72f2953e46ba0e25dd3","0ed2daf9eb921ebcb65eebef8053816b579f458b","73b577916d71111f1dfb5574a92588721a682f44","109df9c9aa5144cdb13224b0cc4be030a366feb2","a4b4024c26eb02519b6af896ec806af5a43bcc6b","48ef1279bb903bb3a5d82d502ac82b0c71e636ff","8113043e87ef33e20844bfb4e8045b1041515932","6343801b59c98b27ee705cd34c8343ee4f544f98","7c59a54ad99e0fa6507ed5f414dda3b232445214","454eec365d6ba26bc7213adba84574755a184eaf","0728bf8ae5e69eab53fb45799d609950501f10d3","7d0935a144915857f043fdb48e9217542aba35ce","134f6da45d1bbeae5467cffc805e2841dc374c6c","c6aa9288e52a574f7f97d116be9e6cefaef6eb4c","d47a0c1e2b1e1d40a19f9960533cf707fd33f30b","a65ed9ee44c2378e7340c5b82dbe3b65f3df7775","61a9a119e9cd76fd11e606b1a3b02ad7b2afba86","995f887e536db19d30d6cd10cc1892396d604df6"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Physics"],"year":2008,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"10.7907\/A0NQ-TD75.","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7907\/A0NQ-TD75.","pmid":"","magId":"2097222532"}

{"id":"4ca503e6d539a2a2a4247d91403e1d9f989de17a","title":"A Prospective Study of Anterior Segment Ocular Parameters in Anisometropia","paperAbstract":"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in anterior segment ocular parameters in anisometropia >1 D. Methods This study included 202 eyes of 101 subjects ranging from 10 to 40 years of age with anisometropia of 1 D or more. The subjects were divided into groups according to anisomyopia, anisoastigmatism, and anisohypermetropia. After providing informed consent, each patient underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination including cycloplegic refraction, best-corrected visual acuity, cover test, axial length (AL) measurement using A-scan ultrasound biometer, keratometry, anterior chamber depth, and central corneal thickness measurement. For each participant, the eye with greater refractive error was compared to the fellow eye via paired t-tests. Correlations between parameters were studied using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The average age of subjects was 21.7 \u00b1 9.3 years. Of 101 subjects, 31 had anisomyopia; 42 had anisohypermetropia; and 28 had anisoastigmatism. A predisposition toward greater myopia in right eyes was noted in anisomyopia (24 of 31 subjects, 77%). The inter-ocular acuity difference was significant in all three groups (p < 0.01). As the degree of anisometropia increased, there was significant positive correlation in the difference in AL in myopes (r = 0.863, p < 0.01) and hypermetropes (r = 0.669, p < 0.01) and the difference in corneal curvature in anisoastigmatism (r = 0.564, p = 0.002) and hypermetropes (r = 0.376, p = 0.014). A significant positive correlation was also present between the anterior chamber depth difference and refractive difference in hypermetropes (r = 0.359, p = 0.020). Conclusions This study showed that anisomyopia is correlated only with anterior chamber differences. Anisohypermetropia is correlated with AL differences as well as corneal curvature difference and anterior chamber depth difference. The amount of anisoastigmatism correlates only with corneal curvature difference.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/4ca503e6d539a2a2a4247d91403e1d9f989de17a","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/synapse.koreamed.org\/pdf\/10.3341\/kjo.2017.31.2.165"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Neha  Singh","ids":["145582102"]},{"name":"Jolly  Rohatgi","ids":["47470094"]},{"name":"Vinod  Kumar","ids":["46511343"]}],"inCitations":["0699ba751fdad4ae64c9211ba2503060750fcfbd","d77e2e2feb745b1d8980cdcfd436fe01089cb498","ad9a4afd6d7bf665cf34286d0f4beb8a5010d5a2","f1b617b9ccd052584f374ac54061c744654b184c","94a02703e7053a7d0072a5ef292f9010ab6878c8"],"outCitations":["239ea39fbfa922b94fae4839e4d868b79073449c","82f8e34bd42002f4748162c50b891b66db8ae72d","60116d80e9bbb51f82171ef7202beba9e61540f7","cc65b29ce095f9752b16ea3971b069bf242e0eb7","a58d1c753a3b68149f0dc08d263e09842be2fb3f","fecbc7f3febcae783f78ed1422bbf645641e107b","f6605e19546c898bdfc1760f1da5fa61611e80e9","9c216b6991904ef5223a1cb341e5d0d0e53a7091","e5639868dad23373205633eb4323bb570787bc6e","7637871ac27d9f61e16417680987fe083512d095","711be6985f2cc065ef7590430f9356357db81a2c","b03ec9c1d9cbd9cf27844abf71c9290820c9611d","da8bb31177ebdcc41c350103e4adec85786c7b2f","0b4a51e59a90bef0e7ddfc4bfd8d4c4cebcf4e76","f772020458bed5ad5e940ca81d4cbd797097c142","022b37700f2a17e3facb67842864a1f911310ea6","95c150e01f2a799a47fd92420dd7e2bd8b0bc7d8","e837892275c75c2eb2bd4e80aa9121ed2004b8e2","71a18b0bdf5d5b5a678433d763e82482f95ecda5","cdd8cdfc21ea0ffc8c8c64f5e8aad4a6f6a0888c","ebb3cd3b99337bf8283f0fc7f3083cff99a1c3d5","6118cac2c8960e70375540f227d077e54a216339","4b42f6e227680486df7e0f6b2d877c3aae009b40","3441ebb357e151793a24a395d3da6e30d16aa6a5","cd1c71d3557e7a0b680c7b9f9ec9de0c8ea0ad8e","15b94a636fbb470bf408f5dd8d566e8d9322deaf","20dd249d389420f5003feb40b36f0ce48eeff26a","351c1b3af6a88ceb711bfef82f868eb961fcd156","491e12329b7d6ab5a176086612a8ae71c8bd5378","5313fe48a397e3a39a145c12d15feaae5345da80","169ff9cb551b939a7578c15bfca51631e16ef4d2","68ffc3efc75881761498e223161663a285cd28c6","2d48b501a1c791975b396d6d5824d21acddcfe7e"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2017,"venue":"Korean journal of ophthalmology : KJO","journalName":"Korean Journal of Ophthalmology : KJO","journalVolume":"31","journalPages":"165 - 171","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.3341\/kjo.2017.31.2.165","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3341\/kjo.2017.31.2.165","pmid":"28367046","magId":"2597443832"}

It most commonly arises from dominantly inherited mutations in the genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 that encode the chains of type I collagen. A number of recent reports have suggested that mutations affecting the carboxyl\u2010terminal propeptide cleavage site in the products of either COL1A1 or COL1A2 give rise to a form of OI characterized by unusually dense bones. We have assembled clinical, biochemical, and molecular data from 29 individuals from 8 families with 7 different mutations affecting the C\u2010propeptide cleavage site. The phenotype was generally mild: The median height was \u223c33th centile. Eighty percent of subjects had their first fracture by the age of 10 years, and one\u2010third had a femoral or tibial fracture by the age of 25 years. Fractures continued into adulthood, though rates varied considerably. Healing was normal and rarely resulted in long bone deformity. One\u2010third of subjects older than 15 years had scoliosis. The teeth and hearing were normal in most, and blue sclerae were not observed. Other features noted included fibro\u2010osseous dysplasia of the mandible and Achilles tendon calcification. The mean spinal bone mineral density Z\u2010score was +2.9 (SD 2.1) compared with \u20132.2 (0.7) in subjects with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency mutations. Bone mineral density distribution, assessed by quantitative backscattered electron imaging in bone showed higher levels of mineralization than found in any other disorder. Bone histology showed high trabecular volume and increased cortical thickness, with hyperosteoidosis and delayed mineralization. In vitro studies with cultured skin fibroblasts suggested that these mutations interfere with processing of the chain in which the sequence alteration occurs, but the C\u2010propeptide is eventually cleaved (and detectable in blood), suggesting there are alternative sites of cleavage. The precise mechanism of the bony pathology is not yet clear. \u00a9 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/3ed47627ed361fc2490b47bd9b55ec3c49e2025c","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Tim  Cundy","ids":["77628983"]},{"name":"Michael  Dray","ids":["4413952"]},{"name":"John W.

Results show that dibutyrylcGMP, the cGMP analogue, and sodium nitroprusside, the guanylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on the luminescence of O. aranea and O. californica. On the other hand, cGMP could be involved in an inhibitory control in A. filiformis. Dibutyryl-cAMP, the cAMP analogue, and forskolin, the adenylyl cyclase activator, had no effect on maximal light emission, but the adenylyl cyclase inhibitors MDL-12,330A and SQ22,536 affected the kinetics of light production in both Ophiopsila species and strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in A. filiformis and O. aranea, suggesting cAMP pathway involvement in photogenesis. The phospholipase C inhibitor U-73122 also strongly reduced KCl-induced luminescence in all three species but this effect seems to be unspecific since U-73343, the inactive analogue of U-73122, equally inhibited photogenesis. Therefore, the results suggest that luminescence control of A. filiformis, O. aranea and O. californica is mediated by cAMP in synergy with calcium.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/69ce028dc32bd3a701fedd07e2600e4c5aace3a9","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/jeb.biologists.org\/content\/jexbio\/206\/17\/3007.full.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"C  Vanderlinden","ids":["6084766"]},{"name":"Y  Dewael","ids":["5454911"]},{"name":"J  Mallefet","ids":["4018315"]}],"inCitations":["debc4fa1c61bae51e959b7c00be0df20f69045ea","2db7200857984d7014eef048316fe925a21f98af","78d83772de13bbaa90fb24a1dff3416a924779b8","6ddcaef7aacc808a3035998f002677a6f4771da8","fd2880eea206a5108a197b9da63467be89303ca3","c0c8cceb2bdf082f1041f7b26e21f7725b1511ef","5d3a1ef010a8d590d2cb0c67a135233b3f0741b7"],"outCitations":["686443bde87f2790ac844c61cf8141be801df163","dc9bfbc7d6e578ced3dd3c20ae174e12f54fb8b0","7cea1cf0a1788658f41742306bdc7f5b3f68cc7c","4fbb91e6bb3c2fc08959f368c69bd51c59c1a83c","b3404458f6d2dcb8dc721290679628f0288a89de","75a1b149c6e3a206202b101bed3e33a4d858e0a3","b7dba360e6d152550307510277653bf4e61b782d","62b0d29397ffec021d7ab6c1d35c78bfc556a3fc","7a5b2f20e79ce6102dd1e0b79678ed619d3bae87","8dd9d4e5026967891ae78e87d3ede83e01c32ae4","95c77ced76f664f79a683633b739955cf13908f9","0d74a0f8eb42aa5e51b5a47d9606916cefc73863","bc135256a8f436255844019a3b759721ee6b94e2","bd68897f68152d6cbf5193a909c2ef3e67473c0c","0525cc20a7fa2021e8d26b8998f9299ba1432b25","4c1d6f58de0b006f863c93700d3e18ad87f63294","d5c1f9aa9388a4f66688f3f7f907b18354b0e2ac","07d5c77d1613220c33c12e1e17dee4fb1f53edae","ad246cb6b06fac2bcc0b636c0ab010768e30d193","631095f5b058362411b3ea635499654b77361543","db5e346b46489d4e55994233b221f4307dc5197a","dc9675182fb033b86a8a1db6ed13d11eaf13ee60","ba74a6b1d74d00e131ca989f1c484b5cb47e93f0","34d5c5c179401b210c9fdad9f3490467ad5060f3","ada37f7513e10b3b144b17bba01a38bda20b47b5","a44e67086c787d1fce1ad24fe6e7f19be390e8d2","7b8571237fe8a4073d120815e737a5958a10e87a","c7c3178c6c80953952d304085c38dba817eb2b7f","64e3ad73c0a1663f7b2c52d2ba8a13fe76f70e97","953c1e85046b0b37c182bc45d574ee63953068ab","9570888c6ea1e2eeb2a4ff1db9cb6530062825d6","330d3b8e0656fd7f8927b46acd1560110580053e","41f4bac2e2e00d771608330b7718f709ad8059d6","a292eee9ca6904a9c888118777f8f305f11aa6e8"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Medicine"],"year":2003,"venue":"Journal of Experimental Biology","journalName":"Journal of Experimental Biology","journalVolume":"206","journalPages":"3007 - 3014","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1242\/jeb.00520","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1242\/jeb.00520","pmid":"12878669","magId":"2099670399"}
{"id":"901b049454cb8112073362663c7d86238ca854b6","title":"Protective Efficacy of Newcastle Disease Virus Expressing Soluble Trimeric Hemagglutinin against Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Influenza in Chickens and Mice","paperAbstract":"Background Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) causes a highly contagious often fatal disease in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. HPAIV H5N1 also poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans. One effective way to combat avian influenza with pandemic potential is through the vaccination of poultry. Several live vaccines based on attenuated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) that express influenza hemagglutinin (HA) have been developed to protect chickens or mammalian species against HPAIV. However, the zoonotic potential of NDV raises safety concerns regarding the use of live NDV recombinants, as the incorporation of a heterologous attachment protein may result in the generation of NDV with altered tropism and\/or pathogenicity. Methodology\/Principal Findings In the present study we generated recombinant NDVs expressing either full length, membrane-anchored HA of the H5 subtype (NDV-H5) or a soluble trimeric form thereof (NDV-sH53). A single intramuscular immunization with NDV-sH53 or NDV-H5 fully protected chickens against disease after a lethal challenge with H5N1 and reduced levels of virus shedding in tracheal and cloacal swabs. NDV-sH53 was less protective than NDV-H5 (50% vs 80% protection) when administered via the respiratory tract. The NDV-sH53 was ineffective in mice, regardless of whether administered oculonasally or intramuscularly. In this species, NDV-H5 induced protective immunity against HPAIV H5N1, but only after oculonasal administration, despite the poor H5-specific serum antibody response it elicited. Conclusions\/Significance Although NDV expressing membrane anchored H5 in general provided better protection than its counterpart expressing soluble H5, chickens could be fully protected against a lethal challenge with H5N1 by using the latter NDV vector. This study thus provides proof of concept for the use of recombinant vector vaccines expressing a soluble form of a heterologous viral membrane protein. Such vectors may be advantageous as they preclude the incorporation of heterologous membrane proteins into the viral vector particles.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/901b049454cb8112073362663c7d86238ca854b6","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article\/file?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0044447&type=printable"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Lisette A.

The system uses the TextTiling algorithm to break a given document into segments that are centered around certain topics within the document. From these segments, keyphrases are generated using the KPMiner keyphrase extraction system. These keyphrases and segments are then used in generating queries indicative of the segment, and consequently the document. The queries are submitted to ChatNoir for finding plagiarism sources in the ClueWeb09 corpus from which the pan13 dataset is plagiarized. The target is to lessen the overall search effort while maximizing the performance by scoring unconsumed queries against the already downloaded candidate sources. Comparison to other PAN 2013 submissions for the same task, show the presented system to be one of the top performers.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/7254dd87771000e7e7ef853a9433e258fc2b5856","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/ceur-ws.org\/Vol-1179\/CLEF2013wn-PAN-HaggagEt2013.pdf","https:\/\/pan.webis.de\/downloads\/publications\/posters\/haggag_2013.pdf","https:\/\/pan.webis.de\/downloads\/publications\/slides\/haggag_2013.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Osama  Haggag","ids":["2830669"]},{"name":"Samhaa R.

These patients are at high risk of herb-drug interactions (HDIs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). We aimed to determine clinically relevant DDIs and HDIs leading to pharmaceutical intervention.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPatients starting a new anticancer therapy were asked to complete a questionnaire to identify concomitant use of any over-the-counter drug or herbal supplement. Potential DDIs and HDIs were identified using two different databases. If a potentially clinically relevant DDI was recognized by the clinical pharmacist, a notification was sent to the prescribing oncologist, who decided whether to carry out a suggested intervention. Regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with clinically relevant DDIs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 149 patients were included in this study, with 36 potentially clinically relevant DDIs identified in 26 patients (17.4%; 95% CI, 11.3% to 23.5%), all of them leading to therapy modifications. In total, four patients (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.1% to 5.3%) had experienced clinical consequences from DDIs at the time of pharmacist notification. Additionally, 84 patients (56.4%; 95% CI, 48.4% to 64.4%) reported using concurrent herbal supplements, and 122 possible HDIs were detected. Concomitant use of two or more drugs was independently associated with high risk of a clinically significant DDI (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08 to 5.91; P = .03).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPotentially clinically relevant DDIs and possible HDIs were frequently detected in this prospective study. A multidisciplinary approach is required to identify and avoid potentially harmful combinations with anticancer therapy.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/d15e62a2770fc2eeab4440afbd9e78f7212cca29","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Allan  Ramos-Esquivel","ids":["1399823240"]},{"name":"\u00c1lvaro  V\u00edquez-Jaikel","ids":["1432846577"]},{"name":"Cristina  Fern\u00e1ndez","ids":["144910277"]}],"inCitations":["b5c5ce063ca608bac1c8e49205c79683405d0bb2","d420bb19f47c48aaf424bf221ce6ddbc42e5de19","60c09007109a38997227ad065bc6221d25777618","e7a4eae5bc97a5dc97189e3faa40ef9a91bb3207","874113b5cfdfc86e6df3e43395205977c827ee68","a048cb707d6fabdd05e9edb1125f391d58daa36d","6bb4d56a49cafeb86f95c9fc4e5beb5f50122ad4","25add83331b266709d3119c65581251b37eff989","37011f21a5b3ba18b3a4cb87436c0e34fa9b706f","d47f8507ae3b4172ec031deaabbd40fbc6dae517","aada53f8abcb01e2ecd3189417403b549f743b06","7fa9e75e7df09741a854250f57994ae017243eed","0817a334df48817dd297104c14be9c2518a9be48","1551dc2b62315a9e9571a78532d57212a4b987b3","7c31b6d0975a38e81dcc605e7aa25042c2335183","df115cb298c6ca81a6f281bdadf44bb391447888","5a6fde088816fc85fb3989123ab77b12e5c33c4e","03536e8fae15bba3195d44d20f750f704dc0a579","ec8050703c0bec7c187f69d27925b78a94ab41f8","0220bb7467f950ddaf8446204f0a0b17366578af"],"outCitations":["543570ba2c33fa25ff255dde1e561c24fdbee4f7","cf0eb6121d8b30cb565130fbd8c0aa07fcf78a63","b06bc6be30a72280501a7ada2b1f14c3fb41f481","1683078cb32502b48ec051ac642057edeb2da1bb","dffeb411ecbfd261082e6bea6316e63c58a8dc3e","1e5b48aab61da716994ca6571d8228b948b82b42","3ef64bc4d54c76b16a93a56f77007e3293067cc9","6d75ec13699a98be4dc1804ee3373b4add9cafaa","0aaef8eb54ca5bbc60caa966e7af4b18628e035a","492dcf9dfa321e0a175f00f95f1e0676acf0c8aa","b734696ee2519ed079a5ee9f66576ae7cc6ffad7","b5db09eb3dc5e85c60f13943ff5103fa306755a3","a1b5a1a80f254c5444bd8ca7e68b8589176a79a2","ebbd34e7975566834cce6b8e731cbaec5b442fdc","9856eb90a93ca82baa4fb39f3cd2677beea68bdd","ddc18ff83270d6153fbb8dcc3f89cb01e4929457","c9eff4e9b926014ac2c03d9656f4b3cece242c2e","9ea3458fd557b028f0bc8dd7b292da328498f989"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2017,"venue":"Journal of oncology practice","journalName":"Journal of oncology practice","journalVolume":"13 7","journalPages":"\n          e613-e622\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1200\/JOP.2017.020859","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1200\/JOP.2017.020859","pmid":"28628392","magId":"2702223968"}

The periodic orbits considered reside in bottleneck regions of the energy manifold, separating large zones associated with motion about one mass, the other mass, or both masses.\n\nThe cylinders have the physical property that all motion through the bottleneck in which the periodic orbit resides must occur through the interior of these surfaces. The cylinders thus mediate the global transport of test particles between large zones of the energy surface which are separated by the bottlenecks.\n\nBy elucidating the structuring role of the cylinders, we provide a new language for discussing some important problems in celestial mechanics. Furthermore, we propose that these cylindrical structures are the natural objects of study for the design of space mission trajectories which take advantage of three-body effects.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/fe09b0eee943efef3cdc3ec14db772fc400c6c08","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/thesis.library.caltech.edu\/1854\/1\/rossthesis_5_11.pdf","http:\/\/www2.esm.vt.edu\/~sdross\/talks\/thesis-talk.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Shane D.

In this problem of heat transfer involved the condition where different constructional parameters are changed for getting the performance review under different condition. An excel program has been developed for the ease of calculation and obtaining result after changing different parameters. The tube diameter, tube length, shell types etc. are all standardized and are available only in certain sizes and geometry. And so the design of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger usually involves a trial and error procedure where for a certain combination of the design variables the heat transfer area is calculated and then another combination is tried to check if there is any possibility of increasing the heat transfer coefficient. Since several discrete combinations of the design configurations are possible, the designer needs an efficient strategy to quickly locate the design configuration having the minimum heat exchanger cost. In this particular problem the tube metallurgy and baffle spacing are being changed the results are obtained. In current paper the baffle spacing and tube metallurgy are the parameters considering change and effect of the same of heat transfer coefficient have been considered.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/78c4a2b0eb1bda7c64ab42fdda995ba4b02c4ff9","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/www.ijsr.net\/archive\/v3i9\/U0VQMTQ2MDc=.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Durgesh  Bhatt","ids":["98916362"]},{"name":"Priyanka M Javhar","ids":[]}],"inCitations":["3b476b4038deccf4088a99703a92ba1f221c190a","1199e0cd8a80b1411bc28255de0312f897a7ba35","799ecb377ed6dceeba9d8067d17d668c832fc93d","84eb60a301d16e8c2b817d124f00c23b5c1cf3c5","fd04a6118d6cb89dc9ee0c0a425dfdcc1778f3a4","ca98fc92f37b5046fd1c83672b37ae62236eca15","9c8597f4086407d43c3f3d20911991ceb836c06a","72f0b4fa4faf55f656921fd2b2ab726415b7f200","675f2b550029c6bd73aeec745d7b5cf7d890e5c3","646b4bab4a94a09a854cbaa329c1552e04bac006","a20d5888c27244bc15cad7a200e78b507c1525ba","fc53d83572f2234f8a172c14827dc0eb7a6734b2","95722283077c385947952df9492ccd3e5b6161b8"],"outCitations":["745877507c7b1fc09f8013deab91ac3ff4e05e9c","714c04fa366ce6c8c7582e4d237dc2fb92618d0c","fc2ebddca24cbcfd0751dc01df6d7664ed7b9911","f1b15f51eb963fb8605ea2c2af5874adaf851edf","8991110b25e3761165213918056da0ab95a20673","ff88cc041e37d3e94ce1e8526d15af6fee34e4e6","f9c8e61b54e47a30399b5ba2f116cacded2bff53"],"fieldsOfStudy":[],"year":2014,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":""}
{"id":"dfebd763c96a986d28821ba9d14c34591a97245b","title":"Study on the Impact of Filter Layer Permeability on Revetment Top Layer Stability under Wave Action","paperAbstract":"In the design of revetment engineering under wave action, to resist the wave action, the pattern of top layer-filter layer-core (subsoil) is often adopted. In general, the structure of top layer is usually single discrete blocks, typically accropode blocks, four-leg square hollow blocks and barrier boards, and also acropode, riprap, paved rock blocks or concrete slabs with smaller waves. Such top layer has been provided with many research findings on its stability and is widely used in engineering. Setting a filter layer between the top layer and the lower dike core mainly has two functions: (1) giving certain permeability, to minimize the hydrodynamic load directly acting on the lower foundation soil; (2) giving certain hydraulic tightness, to prevent fine sediment of the lower foundation soil from being washed out. This paper is focused on a special filter layer with geotextile as its upper structure and coarse aggregate as its lower structure. By simulating geotextile with different permeability and coarse aggregate with different size, the pressure of top of cover layer and the down side of the geotextile is tested under wave actions, and compared with theoretical analysis, in this way, how the permeability of geotextile impacts the stability of top layer is studied. The research shows that when the filter layer under the geotextile has high permeability and the geotextile's permeability gets poorer, the uplift force to geotextile and the top layer will be increased under wave action, which will cause damage to the top layer when it is greater than the vertical component of the underwater gravity along the slope surface.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/dfebd763c96a986d28821ba9d14c34591a97245b","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/www.davidpublisher.org\/Public\/uploads\/Contribute\/5678b92043d05.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Liehong","ids":["103125989"]},{"name":"Ju","ids":["1391160139"]},{"name":"Junning","ids":["96371788"]},{"name":"Pan","ids":["121574200"]},{"name":"Chengrui","ids":["69021517"]},{"name":"Liu","ids":["102995798"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["434946b63aab6c5bce6059d2b828eb942a584fa3","5cde50d32efb28ef8552b90feada47eb4f51fad0","a48c8845db61c36dd2a6abf91fe2793055e86102","82e14e0798dd5b45f20db3ac72e23b87bb99a068","066776e3a6517bff1e40f152d1595639c236fa68"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering"],"year":2015,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"327-333","sources":[],"doi":"10.17265\/2159-5879\/2015.06.006","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17265\/2159-5879%2F2015.06.006","pmid":"","magId":"2341692209"}

Phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10q23 (PTEN) is inactivated in a subset and AKT is frequently activated in cancer. The PTEN is the central negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)\/AKT signaling cascade that influences multiple cellular functions including cell growth, survival, proliferation and migration in a context-dependent manner. Dysregulation of this signaling pathway contributes to different types of cancers. The objective of the study is to explore the anti-cancer potential of thymoquinone (TQ) by analyzing the interaction between TQ with the target protein PTEN. Methods: The three dimensional structure of TQ is designed using in-silico methods, and the structure of PTEN is obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information against protein data bank. The query sequence from 8 to 353 amino acids was found to be 85% homologous to ID5R. For the target protein PTEN with 403 residues, protein families analysis covered the important domains in PTEN. Result: TQ showed the binding energy of \u22127.37 Kcal\/mol against PTEN with three hydrogen bonds. Conclusion: Present study suggests that TQ might inhibit abnormal cell proliferation occurring in cancer by modulating the activity of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K\/AKT pathway.

Compared to the mid-fifties environ-mental noise levels (sources such as road traffic, aircraft) increased substantially, causing higher noise levels during day- and night-time at home, at school and during out- and indoors leisure time activities. Also, children spend increasingly more time in situations with (many) other children, such as in day care institutions and kindergartens, with high noise levels due to a com-bination of loud voices, loud toys, and bad acoustics. In an unknown percentage of households, nowadays television or audio-equipment is turned on for the whole day, thus creating an ever-lasting noisy environment for the child. Children may be more annoyed or otherwise adversely affected by noise than adults, in part because they possess less well-developed coping responses, and are often less able to control their environments.

{"id":"952d1c1722b707d20c39626ffc4c08a9e63a1216","title":"Human intestinal spirochetosis: Analysis of the symptoms of 209 patients","paperAbstract":"Objective. Colonization of the colorectal mucosa with spirochetes is very rare. Owing to the small number of cases, it is not clear from the currently available publications whether spirochetes colonizing the colorectal mucosa are harmless commensals or pathogenic organisms. Furthermore, the reported complaints of these patients cannot be pooled to identify a characteristic complex of symptoms. The aim of the present work was to describe the symptoms associated with intestinal spirochetosis in a population of 209 patients, and to elucidate the effect of antibiotic treatment on these symptoms. Material and methods. A total of 209 carefully processed questionnaires providing information on the symptoms, treatment and post-treatment symptoms of patients with spirochetosis were evaluated statistically and descriptively with the aid of the SPSS program, and the results were compared with those reported in the currently available literature. Results. Of the 209 patients 168 (80.4%) were males, and the average age of the entire population at establishment of the diagnosis was 50.75 years. The most common symptoms reported were abdominal pain (46%), diarrhoea (51%) and alternating diarrhoea and constipation (13%). In this population, homosexuality and HIV infection played only a small role (6.5% homosexual patients, 3.8% HIV infected). In 72 of the 84 patients who received treatment (86%), the antibiotic employed was metronidazole, and the symptoms improved in 44 of the 84 patients (5%). Twenty-six of the 84 patients (30.9%) were investigated by colonoscopy\/biopsy after receiving medical treatment. Biopsies in 20 of these patients no longer revealed infection with spirochetes, and symptoms were found to have improved in 11 of the 20 patients (55%). Conclusions. If intestinal spirochetosis is diagnosed to be the sole intestinal pathology in symptomatic patients, the bacteria should be eradicated with metronidazole and a colonoscopy\/biopsy follow-up performed, where indicated, in patients with persisting symptoms. Significant results regarding symptoms and treatment of intestinal spirochetosis can be achieved only in a prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study. In view of the low prevalence of this condition, such a study is difficult to implement.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/952d1c1722b707d20c39626ffc4c08a9e63a1216","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Bianca  Weisheit","ids":["11291243"]},{"name":"Birgit  Bethke","ids":["1990690"]},{"name":"Manfred  Stolte","ids":["145340655"]}],"inCitations":["1d1d5653df2c2d87a7adb42e3ee554e2d035ed54","f8c520586e0d5e6d3ef43cd8d4b994d4eec6a415","8a0444bb8f5ec3fcb381814711d70880ea11e318","628939a2524bb15987643e43af60261972c8d936","449bfd1e2c26a58868214713aaa072530548535c","b7c53b0fb04b0600e66699b1095a1179d868839c","63bddd29f384c6416833c96144ef5ac630a032f3","48827de79f41df46909082db4c55a45116532b69","5d082c982d2f30f85512c971bcd24815cb5318f2","1585cf565cd1e1340cae86a48ebfe9a33304833b","ff4b3562a1b22d119f659a59e297e7044b095ba4","95016e7526f3a049015c9c36db7c69190141c911","1abe0fd21d974017707e842a5b0a98e373881a95","fd5beb4bff3207c74f27c3a7d7d49016430db38d","3d4bf096fa378981a0f23bc30858f68b6418796f","219846c495d48464cd13704ff13858ddadc4f83e","f0cddba0673eea4cafb7aeec7303c97a9bb9fa1b","c91ed238d80d85a5afc4605f05c314c93daebd63","dab29a596f8671bfd99020e2f3f1742306092be7","c5622a010d6e823804f8c6470185ad1dd7bf8508","7f35bde945a0b74ce0d8e0a4631acdf5d3480306","e4648eaac12ca699025e6e0aa8b3d27722205abd","49927bf1c9670c9d967fc7a006e56cdc43d39953","4656820808905bf0cece031daf4500e1220dde02","446b5721fb610a5da5e589bac3f451b7c2a7bcdd","79c498d45ab66ea675480a3d91cbb6244db0558c","00cab8153e9b1611cf684bb72f2c1c426319b6c6","7ac4590f6660a37adc7d52a31117669848b289b5","b546d798812879f337ab12c319ddcf1bc8c9f957","458295779d2836e4f0e41b17353d325669dff830","eae09726fa6887fad5bd237525df639ebdadeb56","66060c3f1306d76cdd69ac155572833023e98b3e","f019af06f887229ffb8aa8dca305dfd7158c9236","1680a2d243d0142e68b548ec8428680d7ac95943","fb4c890539903f527de05d43f1065ab991449f59","30442aca60b46840bf6e6d93ec937e63492e5d45"],"outCitations":["12931f89b07eda688231e5c2f6ffd553325745f9","62eb8a4775cdb4c690cb0b6dde816b7d6108a158","5871a768040623618213bc86b051b3c31352ac6e","d3c93fc460e5bb4b80b98ee2ef308299d38e34fc","05a54dc03fa2c6177c32f39a50fff3d633bd28e1","b2181dcad5250c49d3cfaecae02318d761874a7f","da23adb9dfc205d6833993642ce85acefc007cc4","c059fdd57c991c436068ac4fe28e79f0bf75cda6","f6ce6a8a6938cc88b28a4bd2aa564e46d6466177","a83a3d57cc00738c7b06be799a7110c8b191ddaa","6f33eb92b95a5ac95bce363118a1b2fc6b211dee","1b9b9ab028e090dc382f15645130730068b0a3aa","3bd824c209045eacfd94f1637b861c6025b88dd7","650438dea35c2dcb6e20c003867a0c7715cc4bb0","2848062baa26f089df3b2616f9ce8ad0d3039b40","e55e6099a544441286c6457d6d1af51fd49b8efb","6381f217adead10952f3e3a5f4ab64a2857a1e48","74e7338fd9eef36f7835585aae9d3894d5f484d3","7f338582c412c420d2c90040ee27edf0d3a966e1","60b3d62b974c040ec5a0399a65858b319af1357a","2ad4094738e415060edba814e41b2b9e9665ec05","df27c27ed9894ad0c35dc72d78fbe26b48338a7a","bafa40f695b85f866b751b80523afc00294116b9","34a21ee6b51e197ccc7a3bcd4eb9b1e77f135c05","5ad7f0c2a850a46291a9cc60ab69234e8052e1f7","813a205bab56146759c1ad881cf4963954d549fb","5b47907bae776646381ecb6881eaba73cd68aba8"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2007,"venue":"Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology","journalName":"Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology","journalVolume":"42","journalPages":"1422 - 1427","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1080\/00365520701245629","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/00365520701245629","pmid":"17994468","magId":"2044792528"}

This model may be a useful capital budgeting and valuation tool for exploration and development projects, where risks change over the stages. We construct a stage threshold pattern whereby the final stage threshold exceeds the early stage threshold due to drift differentials between the project values at the various stages, value volatility differences, and correlation differentials, implying a rich menu of parameter values that may be suitable for a variety of projects. Governments seeking to motivate early final stage investments might lower final stage project volatility or specify project value decline over time, unless prospective owners are willing to pay the real option value (ROV) for concessions. In contrast, concession owners, more interested in ROV than thresholds that motivate early investments, may welcome final stage value escalation, or guarantees that reduce the correlation between project value and construction cost.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/c7def6fc9469d42bdb337321ff361e78eff6c8ac","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Roger  Adkins","ids":["144273971"]},{"name":"Dean  Paxson","ids":["41094683"]}],"inCitations":["94a156cdc6359a0c90061bb678fa9ef32ed5be6c","a11820060d25bb0715672d5e279c1d93f14b896f"],"outCitations":["75cae9bb7bdef6045970123821f150b190b40121","abec4fcb5e67080dc78f1fe64c348c8aa96572bb","e1379aebd316ac0b59585b5a651b4c2ac4f95acf","eac1245f62877ed02c1c99624e532003c71f8d6a","dc9c11ef1465f2fe680ab2e582699c9f69e789c5","f669bcd260a75bb330eee4721cecbce6f2b834cf","f22256599cc513be281a2a82082d4bac7031def2","8cf74e89b28e76afd639b4c047f452abd39cfbc1","d98ed2a69a0153f7f6e383c1e28837dfa4c6ca48","e1594259ee4f5041a96ec2c344b425d78dd84b4d","8e2ef09bfa32348b81142248eab05b2d464d6fcc","96ce1f6b7b87e229d1a424319b8ceaacdfce2242","9403650cd337031ae407c75ec3ac20aa1b799db6","ec4cb3fd71b6d50e80f0601b6a80b929be2f60fd","77a266acf2a84c6c937686a266cb4771cf69a106"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Economics"],"year":2017,"venue":"","journalName":"The European Journal of Finance","journalVolume":"23","journalPages":"1150 - 1175","sources":[],"doi":"10.1080\/1351847X.2016.1158728","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/1351847X.2016.1158728","pmid":"","magId":"2504708590"}

Plate count was used to determine the relative proportion of different types of microbes in the sample, either as bacteria, fungi or yeast. The samples were serially diluted and the dilutions (10 10) were plated on selective media. Microbial isolates showed high bacterial population compared to normal soil population. Eight (8) bacterial isolates as pure culture were relatively the dominant microbes with population ranging from (1.4 x 10 to 5.5 x 10 CFU\/g). Bacterial and fungal isolates exhibited distinctive cultural characteristics (color, shape, colony size (mm), texture, elevation, appearance, optical property). Based on the findings of this present investigation, the authors concludes that useful potential bacteria and fungi as indigenous microorganism can be collected from bamboo forest in Alfonso Lista, Ifugao Philippines which can be isolated and used for further studies on bioconversion of farm waste into organic fertilizer.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/e6605acd73a11e4021901642f8d58c40e9a34e93","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/www.ijsr.net\/archive\/v4i2\/SUB151427.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Chiemela F.

The global stability of the model is analyzed in terms of two threshold parameters, namely, basic reproduction number, R 0 and immune response reproduction number, R 1 . The obtained results signify that the infection dies out if R 0 \u2264 1 and persists if R 0 > 1 . We establish that the global dynamic behavior of the model has no concern with the efficacy of the nonlytic component. Numerical simulations are performed to support our theoretical findings and to investigate the effects of lytic and nonlytic components on the viral dynamics model. A comparison of two different viral infection models has been performed to illustrate the effect of viral replication inhibition through nonlytic effector mechanism on the infection dynamics. Moreover, a case study of HIV-1 infected humanized mice is presented and the result manifests that the model can fairly demonstrate the chronic stage of HIV-1 infection in humanized mice.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/a59763c714dd2fe0fa10fa5fa583da006568f7c1","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Mausumi  Dhar","ids":["115701388"]},{"name":"Shilpa  Samaddar","ids":["103674975"]},{"name":"Paritosh  Bhattacharya","ids":["145680389"]},{"name":"Ranjit Kumar Upadhyay","ids":["34586885"]}],"inCitations":["a13080e356d689f5f9ab6acebf0ffdd7c29bab72","4f8613d1c728ff17310d491f5596987e29b0f65e","e1a9ea44c4ab4c0479cbb9261c379bc459916a6d","761099fae2eabe91aaba590b65f408d7e12bbe80","71891a222b7adeebbfff06ef42af31cef477eaab","b15515615dd08a622be11c63a8a75ad3760ca78c"],"outCitations":["56dd11f64d76c75b9b16c69200f107ae290e7350","b23ce2547e6ec2138baefe4bc3d530323901a9c4","488c041cd20783d339d31b026803ff8190b798cc","694c10d6f6d825277efa6ffd4c0f85335579d5bc","e55fd86dc65f8969255f6384e6d6a3f66b24c208","b51bf2e219620742a825f34d67432e5684ced6ff","b5ac8c07b8545521ae02b0d28cb89cf63a5af8c9","33a28775a89f76ff904f1ef5c3cdfc69d510c2fe","1d30caae87de22a1c5547a702ed3290a6a878271","7bf0d2abeabb2fc78bc97ad01cb0ad93471e5dfe","b28df697a5d78be8f99cd9b234818ce67f9f56d3","488be36fb6d5c9fed9bc90003dbc14ab6bf313f5","9daf3549d3a28e911b170e15a8852c7efbc344a4","9d788fdcd0ff26614e7314ed7b64a8aeb7a6bb4c","9ffe54cd21f883a99eab667911e3cb390b4c3bcc","c586c5d7dbeaa243b09048419d0d9f86e2b446f8","33f37432c6a58994d1b7ca7c974f1ba11225f338","ed7e6eb6d3b55af87047a8048b47f3802185acb5","da7b2e5b5aa9015be29eddc581de5cd92c6f8473","deef8add6a978783965d3d8fa75eaa6362eddae3","6ac7d0bf56b3e14b0ff9e95b3538f89e1a1cb5dd","f392845ab83d03f757d0fd1b9271e38a409fc6f6","06eed7282e081b9684d7e456d85e5bf9ff3ec0f9","f4befed98342a424b0034b4e871509e8f398f4f8","8aa9557ae7caa47eab4ac2acfc3724bd94671931","087b5a91206c4f505c24b4528e56a942dfba87b3","8af9a2dea2905a406433782f305b649e11d567bb"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Biology"],"year":2019,"venue":"","journalName":"Physica A-statistical Mechanics and Its Applications","journalVolume":"524","journalPages":"1-14","sources":[],"doi":"10.1016\/J.PHYSA.2019.03.009","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/J.PHYSA.2019.03.009","pmid":"","magId":"2922417960"}

Among institutional delivery also majority was done in private sector only (79 out of 138). All Caesarean section occurred in private hospitals only. Caesarean section is more common in higher socio economic class as compared to normal delivery, which is more common on lower class. Conclusions: Majority of Caesarean section in present study were conducted in private sector, which suggests some commercial interest may be at work. Caesarean section is more common in higher socioeconomic class due to their affordability. Good job status and higher education also associated factors for occurrence of Caesarean section.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/c1619ca36e8d499723b477c75b86996da8e800db","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/ijhsr.org\/IJHSR_Vol.5_Issue.3_March2015\/5.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Dhaval  Mahadevwala","ids":["77980164"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["e6d7b7682f55d3c38fd29dc2c14f804f5e4ae6af","3d5aed92eeb06967c06759dff6f860797bb209c1","465db9cb3ddd5fcf12a78a08972a120057fdd075","5eda67116c507ea718edce5be59510950617068e","c6ff490a9addb44374be7b98666ffa3583d43428","453e845116628e6c1fafff05c8185acd33d99fd7","a84aa325562f4053636d37395d2b73e3787542cf"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2015,"venue":"","journalName":"International Journal of Health Sciences and Research","journalVolume":"5","journalPages":"24-29","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"63382748"}

The Swedish Volunteer Corps took part in the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-1940 on Finland\u2019s side. Centuries of being part of the kingdom of Sweden is the reason for the close connection between Finland and Sweden both during the reign of Russian emperors and after winning the independence from Russia in December 1917. Finland remained an important political partner of Sweden and \u201ca country-next-door\u201d in the mass consciousness of the population. Having opened the recruiting centre in central Stockholm on the first day of the SovietFinnish War, the Swedish government concluded, that the volunteers did not break the state\u2019s neutral status, and allowed placing the recruiting posters on public transport. By January 1940, there were as many as 120+ recruitment points in Sweden. The Swedish Volunteer Corps included representatives of all strata of the Swedish society. But there were few professional soldiers or people who had experience of military service among the volunteers. Only a minor part of the volunteers were trained enough to fight in difficult winterconditions. Despite the fact that short duration of this war opposed the Swedish Volunteer Corps to be most vividly in evidence in the course of battling, it became a symbol of a special, very close relationship between Sweden and Finland. It influenced the culture of both Nordic countries because it were the Swedish volunteers who constituted the vast majority of the foreign volunteers\u2019 total number taking part in the SovietFinnish War of 1939-1940 on Finland\u2019s side.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/48b1025ae00e88c360c93992343028a0819046d1","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"\u0413\u0435\u0445\u0442 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447","ids":["103403623"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Geography"],"year":2015,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"21","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"566049057"}

(1) Is it true that good jobs in Hungary can be obtained through friends and relatives? (2) Why do personal connections help people to get a good job? The theoretical part of the book is concerned with the second question. A distinction is made between two mechanisms that might generate contact effects: particularism (personal contacts push employers towards hiring a friend instead of other applicants) and intensive search (contacts reduce the uncertainty of employers with respect to the abilities of applicants). After a comprehensive review of existing theories, hypotheses are derived in order to disentangle these mechanisms. The first reseach question and the hypotheses are examined using a rather unique data set about young job seekers who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. The findings are the following. First, personal contacts help people to find good jobs. It is found that both high status contacts and employee referrals are helpful to find jobs in firms and occupations which are likely to provide long-term earning advantages. Additionally, high status contacts inform job seekers about opportunities that are associated with better earnings opportunities, and employee referrals increase the chances of keeping the job. Second, network resources do not have an influence on the chances of finding a job through high status persons or employee referrals, thus inequalities in network resources do not contribute to actual earnings inequalities. Finally, evidence does not support our hypotheses that would discriminate between the particularism and the intensive search mechanisms.

In the literature, numerous treatment techniques have been proposed for these kinds of fractures. In our study we reviewed 30 patients with a mean age of 75 years presenting a proximal humeral fracture (Neer 2-3) and treated at our clinic with a Polarus nail, with a mean follow-up of 7 years. We obtained 73.3% of good and excellent results in line with literature. Complications were recorded in 6 of the patients (20%) recruited in our study. In particular, 3 cases of proximal screw pull-out, 1 case of deep infection and 2 cases of acromio-clavicular joint impingement syndrome. The aim of our study was to review our case histories and compare them with the literature analysing this complex type fracture and treatment options.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/12df61e2ce285efdfbf3d946a3dac6e2f43a91be","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/www.mattioli1885journals.com\/index.php\/actabiomedica\/article\/download\/3893\/2994"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"C  Dall'Oca","ids":["1420936762"]},{"name":"T  Maluta","ids":["3691612"]},{"name":"N  Leone","ids":["48609573"]},{"name":"G M Micheloni","ids":["6822896"]},{"name":"F  Lavini","ids":["50314111"]}],"inCitations":["51825eb49136d9c3d4be867bf844bd818ad7a4d3","ced39bfa469d3109d9b3175dd02ed0fb27120956","2cf1541b222156c91dbe6c97889f5756102e4d15"],"outCitations":["e4359775eb7da3d1401f56427844a1bfe1b4aaba","59f28a35b756b75fe30e4b3b42cb685ebe753921","5aa539e000c1bb865f691f882037af9094af429e","05a8b46c0072219601394d814e71ace4561b4c2c","0945eed337ef8822ca10e62accd827c9ca65db90","cfc1e0e0d1c08ad889745bf69f36d2e3796be264","139669a09cc4468aaa157686769090c764da1578","a1a82c42a6ecd89c60172f17b18a822d7585a71d","8eb58b14270b78c21ef59ec542fa938fb324dc78","bb88dd24a7218e06ecca713791f6d30bafb6f992","466ed853e1bf8f9d3be2d339a74ae9b62e229ed2","74d77104590a77cbc4357d34b8f7166bf728f7d9","dad784a2aa9b6f4c1ce5a513593d9676473b7270","e7a679c476f29f9be6915a22857baa63d217cd18","a8df7eaeae7b4ffb05894844f1c01825204fe705","0700dbf12b73ec5276ba133507577a0b7c6c4b58","6291a2c0b8e6df922b257e6b5402aa97babc59ee","0935b2cef7488e2a16daab5a9403d1091d24c8ac","4dd9a41bb08d959117e1fd27fcf9cbc2b3d0cc18","a5a08128842bbdeace011150f182565b92819c26","7eb867300a7d9c019e3d215047091c3d545f53ac","15f599d2e3bdca96fba73582c866d220a25c8794","7c1a183a28077556779702adb5cd770ae3d5c3fb","23366455446c29dd589c225a3c3723d189e69b37","b6a4525c0bb3e7e9c7b5bbd9bd4904adaaac1402","fb11f7b6d6ac4752555d7b427b442f43c204e7d6","37a01f00bc80f37c629ec19e033237d30ad9bc9a","99d7988ee072d5b257c62d5c1e88a0071b59ff11"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2014,"venue":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","journalName":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","journalVolume":"85 Suppl 2","journalPages":"\n          25-30\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"25409715","magId":"96142306"}

This paper provides an algorithm free of false deadlock resolutions, A simple specification for a safe deadlock resolution algorithm is introduced, and the new distributed solution is developed in a hierarchical fashion from its abstract specification. The algorithm is probe-based, uses node priorities, and coordinates the actions of resolvers so that false deadlocks are not resolved. The solution is formally proven correct by using the input-output Automata Model.

The sample was composed of 2,361 adolescents aged 14\u201319 years (56.6% female). Physical activity was measured using a questionnaire and environmental (perceived environmental characteristics) and psychosocial (self-efficacy, social support from parents and friends for physical activity) factors with previously validated scales. Perceived environmental characteristics were not directly associated with the levels of physical activity, but exhibited significant indirect associations, mediated by self-efficacy in males. Self-efficacy and social support were positively and directly associated with physical activity levels, and part of the associations between social support and physical activity was mediated by self-efficacy. Perception of self-efficacy and social support, important factors associated with physical activity levels in adolescents, should be the target of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity. Favorable environments for physical activity also need to be considered, since they have a positive influence on the self-efficacy of adolescents.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/18a68f21a57ffa3a777255524a0b7d79c288d2a7","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Cazuza de Farias J\u00fanior","ids":["2623158"]},{"name":"Alex Antonio Florindo","ids":["4185524"]},{"name":"Maria Paula Santos","ids":["35648267"]},{"name":"Jorge  Mota","ids":["152504844"]},{"name":"Mauro V G Barros","ids":["10399381"]}],"inCitations":["694b037896a24d0b3abf4b2cea6744eeca1e417f","ae2809b9e5eca2fa85d1da060d4357658e06db23","d160a7eccd0cef07d5b8db60370fbb61a40fef74","d19fe27e90d8030eaa028a5086ce43478074a1c4","da5a35c27a2ef8cb3ceef9fc1b13ba59b64345e8","40370ca82e433583341650aa6ba0b8b7b3e51a6f","b2b80c0036f2f51547f58cf58158118f1d7f9601","4c449e12bc4e0f999bd0bc9f9d2bf3c7e41e7949","186052df468bf5714eedd16f5ad2ae1ecd3c61c0","97fc7d12a8ac747406ba74f650597fd09349893b","878923e5187a771f316fa10b95aaffb478da426c","36e7bcac09fdb532f2cbf0a05a43dd97e97ef675"],"outCitations":["ca739205fc797e9bbd4a9cff9e0b1c0b27a7c7ac","658d546b5de6f0c7e322af105d8a30e669e3b404","8a40c43c123def6ace173c3259c49f5dca23e8bd","d31145b1615143da705086da732d7af69a2f2e2f","5a068de448f9b884e3c29ac980989c4ab0bed7cb","4d45899049b6ae758ec97b691576279844970048","48facb28c56b02e0a5d4e1475a0606405e03a819","3a6186dc45b57d989f0d00388175fdc7641a53b0","6707a393bde134256489bb55c5a2dc5707760b40","544b998cdc05e7be15cccd7672bb7853e7171914","728fd8dfc28aa589278be09aa5a7207c03af748e","e2996a523826ed6f506af89389a92bf0e37cc511","f12ea2b37862738605236add280919c762aeebcd","283592a79eadede09389e5efa43a3b878cd0133a","2974c881778f48c3a15b2b73963cc6985a4474d2","9fafad5b7ca57d8c304daeceb663590fc1c2d379","a2f3fbfb12e5240b3c6761a360242a61d705c752","23095d9f06c73af0d197ce022e8ee40e42ad6c3b","95e289689f6763cc59e9762a808eeec48a27173e","4dfefc081d1e49de47ae4a44034d1aac27824835","12e16494031b835912c4a82fa391d4f33c217bf8","1f541d8e579492a956db1f48521f3bc2f1ecd47d","1aa844d991cad1499765c17f632227f9bd9ee02f","a0303a9fb2cd7061d5f07d1fd49f0c519be5af3c","318e6365f0b98e5ebf57d69ad669cc867024d40c","c9420418a7e217e88907bc3b3620c9c8ef460445","016a5a7bb1c69da461cf1fce7e63e1435763f3ad","93a51331aac0b76ea6ee851d866a3b7d059d39da","29b0a7739307db7b67c23b0a95e7febda2207fc0","49ea9f4e0306b02d89f35616424af2150add5b18","570a8d9800d296973c18d84b471e9dbc1c341302","78a49289226fce499e253144f45c069e904f1246","ab73882d93d478273b470f7cf9e2c3117538a88e","baeb9a6dedc1af35abecb329c697c478003684a7","8c0a4d72249e49fe191946e38549c47c9a858620","d73a2296cfda3ec92ee76df20d9db8fcc613af1f","26c40a2de127c0e2b7465ab7847eab8734dc6623","8a5ab631ad393b611033491a6e72f6b35f89a4f0","492ba32dc76d3783cff92718eb27a79b65fe6486","e0ae82c50ef0c715831ad9db923cef2cc025b07d","c1cb73bbaa2b6e79eed36249e54f92e0e246c23c","5e71a5e4aadff4e9da012145e0fb51c80f1eefd3"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Psychology","Medicine"],"year":2014,"venue":"Journal of sports sciences","journalName":"Journal of Sports Sciences","journalVolume":"32","journalPages":"963 - 973","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1080\/02640414.2013.873137","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/02640414.2013.873137","pmid":"24479548","magId":"2094060242"}

Therefore, \nteachers can no longer rely solely on traditional pedagogy in English language instruction. More engaging \ntechniques are needed to motivate learning. In English-as-Second-Language (ESL) contexts, students are \noften reluctant to write in English. Their reluctance can be attributed to the lack of a real or compelling \nreason to write, the absence of complementary support besides the teacher-fronted classroom, and the \nignorance of interesting writing tools. Yet writing in English is an essential skill for students to succeed in their \nacademic endeavours and later in their career. This observation instigated the present study to investigate \nthe applicability of wiki for the teaching and learning of English, focusing especially on writing. This study \nexplored the application of a Writing With Wiki (WWW) approach in both secondary and tertiary contexts \nwhere students were trained to use a Wiki tool to collaboratively write subject-related materials. The task \nmotivated the students to write as they appreciated the authentic purpose of their writing. It also boosted \nstudents' confidence that they could be website or textbook writers, besides earning to be critical thinkers \nin evaluating and integrating related content in the materials they developed. The study affirmed the value \nof the WWW approach for English language teaching and learning.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/f426ac3c4e974138a5f7b33eebc1e01473da5178","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Bee Hoon Tan","ids":["79686089"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"year":2012,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"2266166027"}
{"id":"84d62318fb4757df03d103625869a9ef6086bec1","title":"Possible effects of normetabolites on the subjective and reinforcing characteristics of opioids in animals and man.","paperAbstract":"When an opioid capable of forming active metabolites is administered, the total pharmacology is the result of interactions of the opioid and such metabolites, especially normetabolites. Normetabolites may affect the morphine-like characteristics of certain opioids and thus influence their reinforcement in animals and man. Most opioids, when administered in single doses, are positively reinforcing in addicts. Oral administration, as compared with parenteral, facilitates the formation of normetabolites. When chronically administered, many opioids, including acetylmethadol, meperidine, morphine, codeine, propoxyphene, and levorphanol, show evidence of a longer half-life for their normetabolites. Normetabolites may have aversive characteristics and thus impair positive reinforcement of the parent drug in animals and man. For example, addicts do not like chronic oral morphine or chronic oral codeine. Conversely, methadone, the normetabolites of which are inactive, is well accepted during chronic oral administration. Drugs which inhibit N-demethylation will increase the agonist potency of opioids having inactive normetabolites (e.g., methadone) but will decrease the agonist potency of opioids having more potent normetabolites than the parent (e.g., acetylmethadol). The divergent responses of addicts to single doses of opiates as compared with chronic doses indicate that chronic addiction tests in man are needed befored relative abuse liability can be predicted.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/84d62318fb4757df03d103625869a9ef6086bec1","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"H F Fraser","ids":["143861445"]},{"name":"D C Kay","ids":["153576378"]},{"name":"S Y Yeh","ids":["2962444"]},{"name":"C W Gorodetzky","ids":["4415865"]},{"name":"W L Dewey","ids":["4012038"]}],"inCitations":["c976cf7223d46b3dfd9b58529eafe22590fa19ab","2a866a2d14b5f253d5445ea3c3bb16bb84682465","0f125fefa83f4946390da538723a1a1ce6b02840","2316501a2195c5932e82792091cb0ba00e20ca54","78dc9a4ae9eaa2a93518462fd0eb648613e61a29","716871168f0d7056a72e13c4dfa377d0482b488b","7a3553cb1ebe4d2666ec221c1772843cad3575be"],"outCitations":["650c42cea45f2538657ca51bed5b9dfc0b212141","10b7e5aed959f71ff78d8c154593895cfb529fae","f32491f75cb02373c377057923971b915959846b","6357b2ac4c193cf06918d59b79abc1f30f2d7ba1","ce47f6414b98ad93aa21276db3cdc77e8ef3f11b","9bb520fc2fbe167e8aa837e4fd81abdb959e54c3","2471586acbcb3d58e94cf348a66886ba2eda5ad6","9077bc9bcc1b4ce252f0a9027448f6b37c51a465","2136eb6ed45512d03b1de73b9ae0a153f999adcd","8d33c23e38e39546857a30b9636e6c831aa21f67","0f21803749d54f1e42d489d826afbd5a08f343f3","b3308bac16799492be686324bb179ce53bda2e8d","3ab26e34a5bae71615fa9d2934860c97fa47fe99","810fada3f0d8386ba2b9758df11c59ab4f049a8c","47fa52a6685b1de9b621f3908fee7d28be6645a0","87999181ae8a1d7d78d5ca965e82f9324bae8926","07d07c0e161c3325ce35debf6dc6c117cbf76225","67074a6ac3a55a0dd2531f78212e1dc3eced3c50","1e8368c8a8bb12068c0cb0ef991193776a94b8e8","f0b72d31c609f2aa295ee7d35d8abbfb72953d60","ef05fee4008d8701066d3430a7a8e486ac7a5f4a","1540c368c68d36dd41c239c50a6ac4bfa37a001c","583eaae3b2c247427c0497bb29b865867cc16758","bee50a54d476a1f626dc5acd9667d20225f40f63","b3b5379b2ebd300709e4f6dbcd8a1e19af2830a6","af63c828d75acab126a0cb1463794084efae23b6","707a008075e58795054e6d31b967c77510e5943f","58da013f673994faf43ab7e93199d951df0f7123","65c6013a8454d3c0e3edfa21b5a0ae25aee0a750","1567c77c2618ae6c064dd895c0561e077b5b5142","bcbbef0dc6bfb3b6dc082f65b916581f51f33744","df8f72cdef7847188a3d0c6b78329225fed98606","59693fe0ed3e922ce44a5fd470d342ed1cb192db"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":1978,"venue":"Drug and alcohol dependence","journalName":"Drug and alcohol dependence","journalVolume":"3 5","journalPages":"\n          301-18\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1016\/0376-8716(78)90001-7","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/0376-8716%2878%2990001-7","pmid":"101364","magId":"1974916271"}

Intensifiers are expressions that are functionally and distributionally comparable to non-argumental x-self in English (e.g., the king himself, or do the work oneself). Mandarin examples are z\u00ecj\u012d, b\u0115nsh\u0113n, q\u012bnz\u00ec, or q\u012bink\u014fu. The descriptive goal is to identify the paradigm of adnominal and agentive-adverbial intensifiers in Mandarin and to determine the individual conditions of their use. On the theoretical side, I apply the analysis of intensifiers as lexicalizations of the identity function first proposed for German to the Chinese case. The identity function takes referential DPs as arguments, or, in the agentive-adverbial use, the agentive Voice head. The identity function in itself is semantically inert, but if the intensifier is focused, alternatives to the identity function come into play. These alternatives are used to explain the contextualization patterns attested for intensifier sentences. Two competing approaches to Mandarin intensifiers are reviewed and found not to be sufficient to account for the data.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/8fddd127d2143426dd034ca899371178ecedfa21","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/www.uni-stuttgart.de\/ilg\/institut\/mitarbeiter\/hole\/schriften\/Hole2008a.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Daniel  Hole","ids":["48998810"]}],"inCitations":["44e47ce9cdfbd5915bae14634f20b18dc9ba12d9","ae125e9a44747458776bedf17319aace24bb97dd","adb0d85dc8c6b31d01f926b4ac2edd9472b459a9","6daeb629ce8c4036e16c0405083aea53011e7b7b","eb112e6417b2b4d1258b0ba97040a0aa6c388707","9dd00d8a9452dc90ccfd8da995333a9c56698306","f26675b25107a15e5711eb8161420c6e02bf20cc","a0d4efe6c9a00ae2a534cae012ebb88c8fc9b2fb","3bc60c4a21438e980cc8f8576d0c152a62112eaa","efd1f8f006d1589fba680656ac0adf6c81d30921","a95ddc30ff56eaa20501d105264b9edb452e9d58","90ac33651755ca855ce5ae588c958e5eead360c6","033e783b20c74e5fb7fc21c2af6462806f175fe8","b61384ad61865242d882427ffd51b40c8029a382"],"outCitations":["70859d32881e57fe4195f9b8b524f3f4abaa9a80","288c7484735a28aba96768894b9c3cc8f58c9ffa","94f831711fd60791a222d643756b3bb9787d54c3","37ab921dea51d8a3bbb55717ddb5dfc8e8b9ef60","ea82ae375a9b90a802348cbc7b4576b7f37b17f5","7e4df4ffc991df6414df5835fb2b6ebaa000cf23","5505411ac495209c3a7541326b2af25ec51fe051","14f153a47a0f91ee460932753efa6f1751dedb92","e032a8e6932499d5e834b0b67ea02c2b8792d8d1","ae08085c11f77eaaff74a3a481713aea3cf63a1b","6686255dcddfb9189965acdb1948b145a6075908","f8ebaf1db9b2708eec2fcb8b45d0726b05fffa15","a1250285f2f49961f52c8d7ce60791098c325e40","42cf56b07aca683df6ddcd2ba2fc09508f49fc3c","fff273bae9b59cbe3403a7bb00ad3c0429659bf8","9186990ff5526dc9f3f3094c26627e4226b0d7b7","14f4a6a8d41d41d2152f0811204b91d6e25a926a","34123e2dd2f7e6b2d36d690a02697a77e79f3089","92ab01a6c079eafdfe8a453de2f437b199a601ca","fafa5f68bdf9112126d4d024f7822184200595c6","a77fd4e07d8b2329bccf9aea52590f0a485c92f5","53ed1672661b901536ddab87d4694508b9e88616","7dedfaeb5b498d4ce530c7695c1b743ffaa30e55","f3c17a95ea5a5db6c8bcfe07d497b6c469ffa732","f9bcf58276d8e7609d8dc516d58094b5a74cbd19","9d0a2fc9e2313f32cf08d163238849984f49624f","e33291ea8fe85f07b6cd722730235487dc98bdf4","a7cca94dc09a935d071c51f27cfc4db13d225a72","8833cd6f210b5a7b50765a6bda7956ea549b765b","83cecc35a5fd8827f6b6fb1aafecba08c667825e","8aa80194af3ba5588b020492bfda398ae512c262","6f742b434dc53a8606b3648811010231cf00907d","f7f2ca35e934a4dbf34b8c80e9546e68d901160f","bd573e97fcd51d67ff5b7842eb4c14d9aa16659a","49a6e15dc921e656709606fe5f38a84f8af4a661"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Philosophy"],"year":2008,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"25","journalPages":"267 - 295","sources":[],"doi":"10.1515\/TLIR.2008.008","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1515\/TLIR.2008.008","pmid":"","magId":"2084091104"}

Rheological properties of the model slurries vary considerably with the neutralization degree \u03b1. Optical microscope and Turbiscan measurements show that the rheological change is accompanied by the change in particle aggregation tendency. Adsorption and zeta potential measurements reveal that \u03b1-dependent adsorption of poly(acrylic acid) is the key factor that controls the rheology of the slurries. The difference in \u03b1 of the slurry results in a significant difference in the surface roughness and the carbon black particle distribution in the electrode. From this study, it is concluded that the adjustment of neutralization degree of poly(acrylic acid)-based binder critically affects the heterogeneity of the electrode, which can influence the performance as well as the rheological stability in the electrode manufacturing process.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/2862eb8526c42d6e226ffb0f66dce0b93844c5b2","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Sang Hoon Sung","ids":["13375220"]},{"name":"Do Hoon Kim","ids":["7004280"]},{"name":"Sunhyung  Kim","ids":["153274498"]},{"name":"Min Hwan Jeong","ids":["39620660"]},{"name":"Jaewook  Nam","ids":["34959680"]},{"name":"Kyung Hyun Ahn","ids":["6552460"]}],"inCitations":["6940b6385d4843006cd7e448e071e329295daad1"],"outCitations":["856d13f9d9edd1a4dd4956a5aa472c98cd4c66fa","cf0e76b8d064b37644a883588bfb0042aa63f57a","561c5d252bba9e8b6ed259d52f8dcfb34fe7b6f2","b1ce1e2bdebe076001547e8a2c8facedd30efb42","edde0e545b5252d6fe60096139ac4b356f738345","de161af93e49d86da33cb74ec5486343fd3b6a20","aed04d47a6864da41bd0383a00942ccbba83e9d7","8c21b55082a90ba370a7fb34f406c5d68cf8681e","c3fb9f8d5d31e12c5bb39b5a8b45b3e01ea44f35","956c540cbec7d37c7bf10261d2b2ab523ccefd07","107065029aa15893ef7456e07db37ecfe2068507","f0f999777afef6e57cf355cf7c61cf61f84f4dc5","90fe69dd0b8d977fce3c3378fed54a955936ef11","d24ecc75bb876bff31a8e96405c7662934c84c1e","1b815d91317920b55a7bc73811c2000e370bba61","da318976de9046d7ae03ec3073fc60abda5dfc8b","cb145c143fe3a5007cbd8c621b4b105383e65b5e","561c35d957100c1bf0d6aa3891291a99aa6ee07e","bda50c09a8eee3471b982b30ed086920e79242d2","821ad9c491fa3eea019439165d31834d4d64d81d","5bb723816a2983ff4c9eb938e40e96a41a7c0020","0effbf59be6bfec03ff5147187433e9d2ff42729","60817d14d8e4b495a8aa41af33523c117d672dd8","6560791efe8184f2c1f60b6c04beb4be3665525c","c660e7428c92fa802080549f58aacbfbc6fd2462","223d8d9cb6ef1be1ce0b6d7641951862c85798d4","b3b227b860f671628c45a7353c726aebd139231a","1a2a055e6d98a8c43d7b4a83ffaf4fc1b4eb62f5","47839e1f03309d856a3efb89f59f380025c7eafd","dd2920c9d763990e7c716e789f3bac1b6f50890c","bd0177ba7f2021d24f0f174d12e370e6864c3447","dd18ffbc7dad168cc7b1c8133de66cecce6d068f","7a7967a337e982f90016845f0e021474f068767b","92bff156f64be01b611e85eedfe3846552b8e0f5","2340d2db93d52a34baf824eed77474f26b288938","08610ea5f250e31b60a61e957b416f8b433c5f54","38caa7a112624c19f8e2a0f15950a656a9c44b7b","94ca1864fde45e2ba6b0d371f4bcf7371123bab6","8e79b65f059618a8837a82e00274118d1a723629","d7b4fd93fa490aeadd67d2f45cc302fb47c6ade9","cf1e4b1916eb108d43e5b011ef69d7859eb98ad6","bdce7e65c74bf35bcd70a268eb6391a4952472f2","a2a194c9c9cd580ab3814cbb585738fda9a39faf","c118c082ebb64cdfc9aaf61660ddeff3b8995725","7545073802016274cfc48e1ff0c0af8091b17c88","7c43ab163f1c181e54d0b25916f5458a74583e1b","2d7b8b80cfff57c5e92e68dfcfc033e3071e0806"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"year":2019,"venue":"Journal of Materials Science","journalName":"Journal of Materials Science","journalVolume":"54","journalPages":"13208 - 13220","sources":[],"doi":"10.1007\/s10853-019-03846-5","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s10853-019-03846-5","pmid":"","magId":"2963628404"}

This paper reports one of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) contributions to AREP. It compares performance of alternative refrigerants to that of R-410A and R-404A for heat pump and medium temperature applications, respectively. The alternatives reported in this paper are: R-32, DR-5, and L-41a for R-410A and ARM-31a, D2Y-65, L-40, and a mixture of R-32 and R-134a for R-404A. All performance comparison tests were conducted using scroll compressors of ~1.85 tons (6.5 kW) cooling capacity. Tests were conducted over a range of combinations of saturation suction and saturation discharge temperatures for both compressors. The tests showed that, in general, energy efficiency ratio (EER) and cooling capacity of R-410A alternative refrigerants were slightly lower than that of the baseline refrigerant with a moderate increases in discharge temperature. On the other hand, R-404A alternative refrigerants showed relative performance dependence on saturation suction and saturation discharge temperatures and larger increasesmore\u00a0\u00bb in discharge temperature than for the R-410A alternatives. This paper summarizes the relative performance of all alternative refrigerants compared to their respective baseline.\u00ab\u00a0less","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/58ff9e661f13e387550fa2693df110b306c816a8","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Som S Shrestha","ids":["66865939"]},{"name":"Vishaldeep  Sharma","ids":["94315488"]},{"name":"Omar  Abdelaziz","ids":["46304260"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Chemistry"],"year":2014,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"2291543889"}

In particular, the dependence of the aggregation work on the total concentration of nonionic surfactant has been analyzed. The analogous dependence for the work of formation of ionic aggregates has been examined with regard to existence of two variables of a state of an ionic aggregate, the aggregation numbers of surface active ions and counterions. To verify the thermodynamic models, the molecular dynamics simulations of micellization in nonionic and ionic surfactant solutions at two total surfactant concentrations have been performed. It was shown that for nonionic surfactants, even at relatively high total surfactant concentrations, the shape and behavior of the work of polydisperse micelle formation found within the model of the ideal solution at different total surfactant concentrations agrees fairly well with the numerical experiment. For ionic surfactant solutions, the numerical results indicate a strong screening of ionic aggregates by the bound counterions. This fact as well as independence of the coefficient in the law of mass action for ionic aggregates on total surfactant concentration and predictable behavior of the \"waterfall\" lines of surfaces of the aggregation work upholds the model of \"dressed\" ionic aggregates.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/f9ac41e902fa5ce9d0a1fa26af315eb1df9e0368","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"S V Burov","ids":["50484269"]},{"name":"A K Shchekin","ids":["9790258"]}],"inCitations":["866106da6cd4ab656ce5840b0c62f9935714cd55","3c8c638e209ca980d690536342ff8860d085b64c","ee65eaa12282cf65ff9c0b2a7de65d5d79949f87","8500c014a40c9c87816269e5b6c814016a454142","2f3f9c88fc66796fa069a110fe34b13de0e20385","4bcb1d6edbeadf9b6adad2d08c6f0499d0c6671c","aae29356b8af2dee880e0d1d42dc819a1327f171","c83979ecc0de3cab4780dac3fde50474eddeba7b","1e72ce1351aa90ac3e6c3530f0707d729426f2f1","69a5c2383a523bc91f22baeb18d2d49df6b4e46f"],"outCitations":["e7519bcd105dae51507ff2b6e2f8d85b4c3a3ad1","16dc28a099adf042a6d24203250cbffac1d23f4e","26931b6a89735a242e47c3075c9de6170cfeda4d","f2399f8cb3e48f3db8f58331956326060ac6fa42","ae01e7709acd3e8192c537ffa6dd6e2c95e21125","38548ef22dd9c9f1405ae3fa57b30e2f205a0c42","074eae42afefe5eb32ece8334c1b75732dbc788f","5c395eaf0481ba0d6bb66472d671f2d628056b95","328187ee718a499c8b67621760ce90479e35a003","55e77209fcc2113d45184ddb5e6a0de25dc1af16","b4422ae50cbfc979df9a319c7bc45750055f817e","47e9a9bf883321e0b78ac16ce51ee65442cf0e6e","0b42bd5fb6ee7dc51704a9574ab6b81e4c30f45f","96df49c3391c2c6ba79d61a1d8d34219b7cd23d0","56184aa38e165220359d6dc691afb4a5a936a9ee","628e8a49473db420a5af3ca6f1a93e851e9e1d67","f6380f7f090f2cae9fe723dae1873adf57126400","90e1598464ef407dc3a42caea0977a738eb0d82d","15701f9c80f2286e98110d26893c807f15e418d7","d16ac2c874f67f56e1b5adbef834fcb080d102ec","c53db5c31b5c51a3378705795d4af96d95b4ddf9","3aa2f0caeb47c6930844b870a2da9c12a60aed27","2524fd6adb8c7ff1926d2e25c1d2903a20828285","ec95c4ee902039f0d1906511350bce64e235d87a","ab7d72aade977e7c55ebcdff28c7eb5e59ff3a12","d3be95446edff480bb6abc900e2320696702e893","391bf710048d56a5a4875f44804984d56d911bea","06be85deb057b9a2c9a64ba1ad82947fa1deb6e9","e4fbea4bc255a515103e1d9a4402d2c5ea456e15","037c65b8aea0af213f08fb0912660f94d9ea0820","3abdfe577485655790d6dfa4d0a2c1d66a9e2149","785552c07ea069db68976df591a9b7f1dc1c8ab2","edc134ce9b154e527e778fa1fe0834a791092f8d"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Chemistry","Medicine"],"year":2010,"venue":"The Journal of chemical physics","journalName":"The Journal of chemical physics","journalVolume":"133 24","journalPages":"\n          244109\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1063\/1.3519815","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1063\/1.3519815","pmid":"21197978","magId":"2049898366"}

Chitin inhibited the growth of either cells. No matter the tendon cell or the fibroblast, the amount of cells adhering on the carbon fiber was far more than that on terylene or chitin. When the three materials were interlaced together, the collagen fibers produced by the cells were arranged in direction parallel to the carbon fibers.

If, in a warmer world, bacteria decompose organic soil matter faster, releasing carbon dioxide, this will set up a positive feedback loop, speeding up global warming. I was stunned to learn, from an article by Charles Tarnocai of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in Ottawa and his colleagues, that the global mass of soil carbon needs to be revised upwards by a frightening amount: from the 2,500 billion tonnes of carbon previously accounted for to more than 4,000 billion tonnes (C. Tarnocai et al. Glob. Biogeochem. Cycles doi:10.1029\/2008GB003327; 2009). This is a result of the previously overlooked presence of vast amounts of peat, Siberian yedoma deposits (organic-rich permafrost) and other frozen carbon stores at high latitudes. These massive stores deserve special attention because the boreal and arctic regions that house many of them are expected to warm more rapidly than average in the coming decades. Even a small leakage from these stores could cause an explosion in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 as well as methane, a potent greenhouse gas emitted by flooded thawed soils. So what do these findings mean for the role of high latitudes in the Earth system? We need more extensive field observations to monitor the stability of frozen carbon, and studies to measure the decomposition rates of such stores. And we should incorporate these processes into climate models such as those used by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. If I had to pick just one new PhD subject right now, exploring this terra incognita of frozen carbon and its impact on climate change would be the one.

Based on the scope of content covered, ICT integration can happen in three different areas: curriculum, topic, and lesson. This paper elaborates upon the concept of ICT integration, and presents a systematic planning model for guiding ICT integration in the topic area. A sample of an ICT integration plan is described in this paper to demonstrate how this model can be applied in

When Tor is used, performance is sacrificed over anonymity, as the Tor network is for many reasons, slow. In this report it is investigated if a Raspberry Pi has enough performance to act as a wireless Tor gateway, and to investigate any potential bottlenecks in such a topology.Two scenarios were measured: one where the Raspberry Pi is configured with Tor and one where it is configured without. The data rate, the retrieval time, and the CPU load are then measured when a website is retrieved (one which is located in Sweden, and one located outside of Europe). Further measurements were done to measure the processing unit's impact on the data rate. It was found that the Raspberry Pi is fully capable of being used as a wireless Tor gateway, and that the bottleneck of the topology varied depending on if the Tor network is under heavy load or not.When Tor was heavily loaded, the measurements showed that a higher clock rate on the single-board computers CPU, as the network itself couldn't transfer any faster. When Tor was under light load, it was found that a higher clock rate was equal to a higher data rate, and a 30% shorter time of retrieval.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/5d96b52176515f263e072d36a25279fb473e0fcd","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Samuel  Sandberg","ids":["153106460"]},{"name":"Mathias  Larsson","ids":["116491409"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering"],"year":2015,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"748945749"}

The applied research method is statistical analysis (SPSS) of data obtained from questionnaire distributed in 2018 (mixed mode: CATI + CAWI method) to respondents from representative sample of 297 Polish INVs. The relationship between variables related to strategies and market performance measures shows weak correlations in line with the hypotheses: positive correlations with increasing adaptation, positive correlations with increasing differentiation, positive correlations with broadening vision of the market. Cluster analysis made it possible to identify a disadvantageous mix of strategies: The strongest product standardization combined with the weakest product differentiation together with addressing commercial efforts to niche markets led to the lowest results on all market performance measures. A non-segmentation approach led to the best results in 3 out of 4 market performance measures.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/21c3fd07740fb78f97881c23c238789f0d6c36f1","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Tomasz  Sikora","ids":["3209731"]},{"name":"Ewa  Baranowska-Prokop","ids":["1416665725"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["4861ab41079a11f1c9f4a012887c6ceee0af208e","d7e3dce06dbea464a6d3dcf524cb40f6032a0f01","aeac391c92b90857c27b50a2f6df51e26af7ac3a","bace2575e8bdfbfbab059c22035394922c4f176f","0b0d9d3cd16765f1a4b4bfc70af890fa6fd76cb6","182224d758995e9f2519b2fb01d51a57bb0d6963","13852b3c1c14857833e364a367a73286ea6e2a1d","db72614df0e329c86c648b490d4d73f00be7eb8f","99418bb89bb9eae256a2a39feba8c69ce5c61cac","66e4d658924a14a66c5c09d6131eb9fce486a290"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Business"],"year":2019,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"355-371","sources":[],"doi":"10.1007\/978-3-030-38253-7_22","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-3-030-38253-7_22","pmid":"","magId":"3006951385"}

My theoretical framework is a continuum between two theories: intergovernmentalism and supranationalism. My aim is to find out which of these theories better describes the development, current situation and the foreseeable future of the CFSP.I also explore the structural possibilities for working foreign policy and contemplate its meaning for the whole integration process. My method is purely analytical, using the findings of my material and previously done research. I have used as material Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and the European Council Declarations of Cologne and Helsinki. Theories have been presented using the prominent writers of each theoretical tradition, e.g. Andrew Moravcsik, Michael Smith and Paul Pierson. My case study is Yugoslavian conflict in the 1990's, beginning from Bosnia and ending to Kosovo. My intention has been to use it as an example of functioning of the CFSP, and analyse the reasons for its failure. I also present the current security situation in Europe as a context in which the CFSP is supposed to work. The question of European security brings up the need and the obstacles in the way of security co-operation. I have emphasised the relationship between the EU and the NATO, as they create the balance in Western security hemisphere. Here I am using the new framework for security by Barry Buzan and his colleagues. My conclusions show that although the CFSP has been unable to fulfil the expectations of the Maastricht Treaty, and has faced difficulties in overcoming the intergovernmentalist practises, it has over the past year taken a step towards supranationalism somewhat unexpectedly.The leaders of the EU have found the need of developing common defense policy along with the deepening integration.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/bb58b18a884a84f2b670e3ff9b54ef1733d377e3","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/helda.helsinki.fi\/bitstream\/handle\/10138\/10247\/abstract_fi.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=3","https:\/\/helda.helsinki.fi\/bitstream\/handle\/10138\/10247\/abstract_en.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Maarit  Hyv\u00e4ri","ids":["119920070"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Political Science"],"year":2000,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"2234129745"}

The case group was 183 male patients with silicosis and the control group was 111 male silica-exposed but without silicosis miners. Data on total dust concentrations was collected to estimate cumulative total dust exposure (CTE) of each subject and each person's characteristics and work history were obtained from questionnaire. Polymerase chain reaction re-strained fragment length polymorphism technique (PCR-RFLP) was applied to detect the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844. Associations between polymorphisms and risk of silicosis and stages, interactions between polymorphisms, between polymorphisms and CTE and smoking and haplotypes were analyzed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no differences in the FAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844 genotypes between the case group and the control group (P > 0.05). No association was observed between FAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844 polymorphisms and silicosis and stages (P > 0.05). The frequencies of FAS-1377G\/-670G haplotype in the cases (9.6%) were higher than those in the controls (3.6%) (P < 0.05). No interactions between the polymorphisms of different genes, the gene polymorphism and the total accumulative total dust, the gene polymorphism and smoking were observed (P > 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFAS-1377, FAS-670 and FASL-844 polymorphisms are not susceptible factors of silicosis. The FAS-1377G\/-670G haplotype might be a susceptibility marker of silicosis.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/f08ed9191486ef36e31ea5d153cb0a18c511991e","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Fen  Wu","ids":["49604834"]},{"name":"Ya-bin  Qu","ids":["12061809"]},{"name":"Pin  Sun","ids":["34226021"]},{"name":"Fang  Ji","ids":["144642002"]},{"name":"Yu-lan  Qiu","ids":["4448067"]},{"name":"Wen-bin  Miao","ids":["13932007"]},{"name":"Wei  Wang","ids":["49336891"]},{"name":"Ru-feng  Jin","ids":["6390309"]},{"name":"Zhao-lin  Xia","ids":["144574273"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Medicine"],"year":2008,"venue":"Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases","journalName":"Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases","journalVolume":"26 1","journalPages":"\n          7-11\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.3760\/CMA.J.ISSN.1001-9391.2008.01.003","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3760\/CMA.J.ISSN.1001-9391.2008.01.003","pmid":"18302883","magId":"2412535408"}

Energy dispersive x-ray diffraction spectra were recorded to ensure that the highly reactive cerium in the cell assembly remained pure at this temperature. Even at 1100 K the p-V equation of state of liquid cerium shows a pronounced decrease of the bulk modulus above the y-phase region similar to the 775 K isotherm in the solid that also shows an inflection point between y- and a-type cerium. The inflection point in the 1100 K isotherm indicating the minimum in the bulk modulus separating the \u03b3- from the \u03b1-type liquid is located at approximately 3.5 GPa.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/39068e7eecad98200d852ab6bb05c8424f1da6b6","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Magnus  Lipp","ids":["46958973"]},{"name":"Zs  Jenei","ids":["152636684"]},{"name":"D  Ruddle","ids":["5773085"]},{"name":"C  Aracne-Ruddle","ids":["1401956739"]},{"name":"Hyunchae  Cynn","ids":["32036631"]},{"name":"William J.

It has become more clear that bipolar affective disorder should be viewed longitudinally rather than in terms of individual episodes. As result of these methodological challenges, more have been far a few mood stabilizers approwed for use in bipolar disorder. Lithium was the gold standard of treatment for bipolar disorder, but a number of studies over the past several decades shown that many drugs with antiepileptic properties are effective in the treatment of some patients with bipolar affective disorder, especially for those whose disorder inadequately responds to lithium, and those who are intolerant of treatment with lithium. These antiepileptic agents include two generations of drugs: cabamazepin and valproate as first generation, and lamotrigine, gabapentine and topiramate as second generation of mood stabilising antiepileptic agents. In this article are rewiew the pharmacological properties and their efficacy in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A series of 32 patients with bipolar affective disorder was reported. All patients were supervized in the Emergency psychiatry service in Psychiatric Hospital Skopje, as the greatest and most important psychiatric institution in Macedonia. We also summarise use of these agents in combination with other psychotropics.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/bf4ce2ac08e6a0727a2f339d2035afedc9a76219","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"G.

Methods: 68Ga-DOTATATE PET\/CT was used to examine 105 patients, 35 of whom had been pretreated with long-acting octreotide. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of target tissues, as well as metastases, was compared between the groups of patients with (group 1) and without (group 2) octreotide treatment. Results: The SUVmax of the spleen and liver was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (both P < 0.001). There were no significant group differences in SUVmax for primary tumors (28.6 \u00b1 6.8 vs. 32.9 \u00b1 31.5) or metastases in the liver (27.2 \u00b1 14.8 vs. 25.7 \u00b1 10.7), lymph nodes (41.4 \u00b1 19.5 vs. 25.0 \u00b1 6.3), or skeleton (39.5 \u00b1 22.0 vs. 15.4 \u00b1 7.8).

Conclusion: Treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analog did not significantly reduce 68Ga-DOTATATE binding in neuroendocrine tumors but tended to improve the tumor-to-background ratio.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/8c2cb8b19c14423e0159e5589c01421e8d116a8e","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Alexander R Haug","ids":["49346002"]},{"name":"Axel  Rominger","ids":["52307788"]},{"name":"Mona  Mustafa","ids":["145335186"]},{"name":"Christoph  Auernhammer","ids":["4002102"]},{"name":"Burkhard  G\u00f6ke","ids":["48182961"]},{"name":"Gerwin P Schmidt","ids":["49182654"]},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn  W\u00e4ngler","ids":["2116861"]},{"name":"Paul  Cumming","ids":["2786965"]},{"name":"Peter  Bartenstein","ids":["2549397"]},{"name":"Marcus  Hacker","ids":["145443158"]}],"inCitations":["fe0f6780152d9ec6cfa20d1370f45b3909b4ee3c","bbe72c9f8a5f62b5bbea6afcd35117774c7e519a","60b8bfd6c655bc6baa8ea8f5b719608415949d14","dbf1099cf1671f8e3114bea651ecdec92bc8e6a2","214abf9d8a2517f4d8e92fc2e3273554d0dd51e6","b290f8d6d564171f37b5fe10fd90fac3c1af0dd9","696ab7a9700df78a5cb7891077bdc1a7aceb4fee","96905a3cc0b1f07c0fc34802f68f02330f2b7735","da840a137dd82a88b31d78763a5e9a1ea588ab1e","fb0a8c57782f6a5ef579cc99065fd0a39d82da45","0c4fdd2685cd7ec767160920ba54c69320ba5940","d169f35cdecd099531df8d57261c7249190ac160","f739da24cc0851f70eaedc0ffabb1ac6ffa177d4","d380d914503bba0a3d3edb289a639c8d24667d8f","5589fdba023eac5b33df50bb771789b3b65c8988","03c16c1883f03631c6b2cfecab377a8a307190a4","80ea279c52b9702c893b344ec10adac12df8ee48","6be0adf8e8e00bcd6914fe092b60a1c98bde68f2","73696433fee48319330f6650ab506e9a09914a2c","1e77035bca31f3ae9bc640b5a035c8c49736a78a","4803dc08dbaa111bdb07b22816e115593941d0f3","fa6c892b28ebb984802943a82cad4bbc568423ea","77c930ad458743fef8e6a1ed5100ee40dfd0db0c","8dc5ed5e95d9ef27965b3da1924e04e6b133e420","08c1bc40b44fda86a5ed5bac13ef2cf25fe348d4","dacbb7d5668709c655949ec5b37c9c62cd6fcc6f","7d70843b6e2ea4f346b34605e17c543d7b2584f5","018deaf6e08d55d3a1af01daecde22334ae0465b","fde1c5eb4ffa3b4d0ac2048e1cac3ae30ac224b0"],"outCitations":["04dca90056727e6843dadc87fb0720e839b88ffb","79a34e58f239671eb175104bf003ff38f36c8ed7","0031b25ab06a38d88ad43d0a9406d278229066cc","54ac8a81cb61ae4b7c3102cd18da5fedd4850393","bc5507508462a4e807265a82dbd2be8fcbd74a4d","6eeda0659b422a0d55b4ad5a5edbe1cdf6e2d781","9f7cee4ca8ef7d119d7b230b85e65f501f567d77","55403c0f67ffe9f593afe93da17a854f6bbf5143","721725cf2c5d61e6bc8dc713461f9027a488114e","77114b6b437301a72c64e0e1777f3d31db3ed0c4","21aca39b82eb7b79b0acf9b73af76085a2c2daac","a2dfa8b60cf3a477ecabe1ddbe435657d9831281","a3891f2b0f2133a164e97b328dae485cc263e0b2","7de6b65555cea68738e151d9b38800dff0a5640d","e4aec15d4c5d2f3a3cfcf850cfb175c103273f1c","2a5df548787f9160c41c5e9e2674140dddeac51f","66b44d7736009c569d25c5fb1520bed68e1fddac","7fa66f893b58c55a19d6a78cf82cb3c466fbe5d6","c381f1e3ae92dac046c8a6bd962dd219b5c32da9"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2011,"venue":"The Journal of Nuclear Medicine","journalName":"The Journal of Nuclear Medicine","journalVolume":"52","journalPages":"1679 - 1683","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.2967\/jnumed.111.089276","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2967\/jnumed.111.089276","pmid":"21976529","magId":""}

Plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings have relatively high interconnected porosity and lamina structure, which bring out a low bond strength, and lead to a short thermal cycling life. Lasers can be used for modification of materials surface. In this paper, plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings were laser-glazed by a high power laser in order to modify the structures. The microstructure of laser-glazed TBCs is investigated. The change on surface roughness has been examined. The result indicates that a smooth and dense glazed surface with craters and a network of microcracks is obtained after laser-glazing. The laser-glazed region consists of a columnar microstructure. There are segmentation microcracks in the laser-glazed coatings, which don\u2019t run through the coatings along thickness. Surface roughness has been reduced significantly for the laser treated ceramic coatings.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/caa6271bd9093cb1da2ca6fa767b0769df97400b","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/researcharchive.wintec.ac.nz\/4576\/1\/D:%5CHONG%20ZHOU%5CResearch%5CPapers%5CICMSE2016%5CKEM.723.247.pdf","http:\/\/researcharchive.wintec.ac.nz\/4551\/1\/D:%5CHONG%20ZHOU%5CResearch%5Cppt%5CMicrostructural%20Characterization%20of%20Thermal%20Barrier%20Coatings%20Glazed%20by%20a%20High%20Power%20Laser%20-2016%20ICMSE.pdf","http:\/\/researcharchive.wintec.ac.nz\/4561\/1\/D:%5CHONG%20ZHOU%5CResearch%5CPapers%5CICMSE2016%5CPoster.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Hong  Zhou","ids":["145829682"]},{"name":"Fei  Li","ids":["46493888"]},{"name":"Jun  Wang","ids":["40139217"]},{"name":"Baode  Sun","ids":["46425305"]}],"inCitations":["80bb9e2e18bd5321606ff55e150ffb9e071a9396"],"outCitations":["517a45c35f9ad52ac75a27c5a5f190d41cbc5e65","b06a49ba4c8cade576d01745e331285259f79678","60d66f541a7e1a247008bcf386207f72eae1ec47","032fb714aee8325bf628938e6db237a93b6aad34","efa724e7de35f84572f24587b11197334b074c20","318b388a44f8d3f83593c11d20cbb25a204eaf58","700561ee47ffb61dab3ed77cbcade230a186c111","8a98e6cc7562475c8b7ac89a81019ae08c9fdf49"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science"],"year":2016,"venue":"","journalName":"Key Engineering Materials","journalVolume":"723","journalPages":"247 - 251","sources":[],"doi":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/KEM.723.247","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4028\/www.scientific.net%2FKEM.723.247","pmid":"","magId":"2562624060"}

Whether muscle synergies can be used to describe pathological control of movement is still under debate. In this paper, we present a preliminary description of the shapes, timing and weights of the synergistic patterns of three children with CP during crouch gait movements. The synergies and activations extracted from the activity of 8 lower limb muscles show strong differences with respect to healthy subjects and high similarities across patients.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/1e2dc5ea75f5a32640a338bd3cc4b948c8f69c30","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Diego  Torricelli","ids":["2278082"]},{"name":"M.

{"id":"1d9a037dff1face0b3eaa1a106f904dd2402214b","title":"Anomalous diffusion of proteins due to molecular crowding.","paperAbstract":"We have studied the diffusion of tracer proteins in highly concentrated random-coil polymer and globular protein solutions imitating the crowded conditions encountered in cellular environments. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent alpha characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, r(2)(t) approximately t(alpha). We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400 g\/l is subdiffusive (alpha < 1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent alpha decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, alpha reaches a limit value of alpha(l) approximately 3\/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on

Contrary to the trial and error selection of the variable structure feedback gains reported in the literature, the selection in the present work is done using genetic algorithms. The proposed design has been applied to the load frequency problem of a single area power system. The system performance against step load variations has been simulated and compared to some previous methods.

Previous work has shown that enhancing synaptic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in healthy human adults with donepezil (trade name: Aricept) can increase the magnitude and specificity of perceptual learning (PL) for motion direction discrimination in the perifovea. In the current study, we ask whether increasing the synaptic levels of ACh in healthy human adults with donepezil boosts learning of low-contrast isolated letter identification and high-contrast flanked letter identification in normal peripheral vision. Two groups of observers performed sequential training over multiple days while ingesting donepezil. One group trained on isolated low-contrast letters in Phase 1 and crowded high-contrast letters in Phase 2, and the other group performed the reverse sequence, thereby enabling us to differentiate possible effects of drug and training order on PL of letter identification. All testing and training were performed monocularly in peripheral vision, at an eccentricity of 10 degrees along the lower vertical meridian. Our experimental design allowed us to evaluate the effects of sequential training and to ask whether increasing cholinergic signaling boosted learning and\/or transfer of low-contrast isolated letter identification and high-contrast flanked letter identification in normal peripheral vision. We found that both groups improved on each of the two tasks. However, our results revealed an effect of training task order on flanked letter identification: Observers who trained on isolated targets first showed rapid early improvement in flanked letter identification but little to no additional improvement after 30 training blocks, while observers who first trained with flanked letters improved gradually on flanked letter identification over the entire 100-block course of training. In addition, we found no effect of donepezil on PL of either isolated or flanked letter identification. In other words, donepezil neither boosted nor blocked learning to identify isolated low-contrast letters or learning to uncrowd in normal peripheral vision.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/b70491a17293fd4c9c9f445ec8cc0bc923e3167c","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Dennis M Levi","ids":["2595304"]},{"name":"Roger W Li","ids":["40527482"]},{"name":"Michael A Silver","ids":["31743846"]},{"name":"Susana T L Chung","ids":["48749841"]}],"inCitations":["1ecff9c4ddba67bae162626cced2cc1c0daf393d"],"outCitations":["f4a43a7bd3b10aa27a838333086ef4c20c87daf7","1922f7f3cd1cfd9bb50912c547c934cc717959eb","138b655210e88a8060f0024a9e21804eddb3d644","6f329d4989324bf8b1412f4cc9b409a88adcd127","86d76e6dea268bcc290377ed2307910ba79c588d","83ef7b13ed43a3f76c7e5015f073ef309b28008a","d6c19e1a6b780d0a46fdf34c89acdd1af8872d2a","9365b2e0e57342d81e9c04673da0ac26f1456391","268d6ebf460aa54aedcafd6366f5c77d74d9f3e3","446971902117054e778212349cbd5173f3987262","5c66951d7c574ca45abea1eb0cb3cd8812764457","38728574bab6bbfd6d0e9be75939a846d7fbc8df","a60d87564460f19e3b92a5c7e513b64b7fb3182f","08f0f0ca0aa7ed16aa836ae22df67af7f4fc9d7c","1ecff9c4ddba67bae162626cced2cc1c0daf393d","3b3ca5e076bd844f79e04068e565ccc8ff204fb4","e21a35b320ecd7ed69f3d2e7d1c15f67e5ed2691","f2e60108f4977a14c12ffcbbf578aa3360e6a5b9","bcc3d9b45a7d8803341ae1686e82e9b216b90e4e","3ebea6a94db4b594e03f55336737b85ea5826fb1","9948efec005f81fc6d39aae40ddc07bf7ff2959c","9320464b98ae6d580af8a38d93a505c68c71179d","e5b8dcb362fb588fd948cabc9f9a2bb53dbb43c7","c4314729b49f27d5b56a703fa5f8df67bfdb8352","2ae53620a4facc3864f03e1d748beb7ba2b3c426","192e862263fb9e1dd73c96b1fb835db2f107e24c","e6f812d59dae3880b3994e0a7034310c6679b935","a6d10377b070dbd060f32b454600e0ba44866273","149b3dc03c09a1c9c31dad706ffdd1dc3795c165","bde9eb5a294ec85c1d9164434ae5e5082f2b44b5","35e661d28c2a295507598700f13d059a8c537ad0","d818ef42035cda37144d0412201c8020a15264f6","b7bf823a809a6e17071a40a9700515c8c0e2cf7b","1b0ebe4ba4bdc13aedf3e2be04b02772ae9b6915","f18ad5e1f1d05a187458db1878cdccaa4f32b24a","977b4dc916c99d8b80946fbbcf8d529417d7f22a","92509bb74b2f418d71e640b666089c3240c8f666","005c2526a897ee69a29e30af4819b0203bd20205","010a0898b803bd37204312df56bb2908c01909ae","4ef79ba1c1db9058975d914b8cd9b16864fc4601","8de3656de16293d5a48f045c901041390571ed37","34b03a2fdf372d85e09ed810c98028840044741d","71ae0f95b86af2cd1e17db9e55658b81518fff7b","31b6e7e88f6b119a97ae15ff8505f75941f97e0f","16dbb5c1196a4e1a1d0f31fc8367101905d97ded","8e84175cedfa53a92c4392efadb0b1031d816ee3","3ce86e11940293efeec317fa4985e0c657882b7a","3a7d94e5c3145e27bd94def9af6f9d930a6d1779","659061d4d35744118a4b29e45226a07a6dadd4ac","aa92a067746dcc6340adc4964a860496004e5a39","9b21024d94ed2efdb4bd9157e743abfcdbadb4ba","bf01dc6fddc2741bd522d53f4a99c37dd2004595"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Psychology","Medicine"],"year":2020,"venue":"Journal of vision","journalName":"Journal of Vision","journalVolume":"20","journalPages":"","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1167\/jov.20.4.24","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1167\/jov.20.4.24","pmid":"32347910","magId":"3018809379"}

NAT activity in the lens showed significant diurnal variation in vivo and in vitro, peaking during the period of darkness, when the lenses were maintained under 14 hr light\/10 hr dark cycle. Cultured lenses exhibited a circadian rhythm of NAT activity when maintained under constant darkness. However, the rhythm in vitro was not entrained when the light\/dark cycle was delayed 8 hr from the cycle in intact animals. These data strongly suggest that the rat lens contains a circadian clock that controls NAT activity, although the circadian clock appears to lack a photic entrainment mechanism.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/4d11ad28441342ef1eb49a3139e7f3175f784fe2","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"M  Abe","ids":["79891224"]},{"name":"M T Itoh","ids":["2946593"]},{"name":"M  Miyata","ids":["7690645"]},{"name":"K  Shimizu","ids":["50371319"]},{"name":"Y  Sumi","ids":["49927690"]}],"inCitations":["1bd8d36ea2c91423f60d7207e06e30b188862f3b","65f9170df4687a8403f9dffdca970a8813100d04","6de83db981f753d6d70fba2550e38c6f59fe24dd","69863982d64b9c8166eb08e4fb434121d36902e7","b4faeaedcc6237ef051af6e0bd8f3ad1fd453e04","810d88b4f0c268e06d10fa5dbcd5d9dfa39a2382","ae316fc98a75d6f035fdc1d410d8641d34ebc63d","424a2bcbe337ff6211762c6c5dd65c2e17e4c026","0f53d7e144461b022ee9d02016742ea67b15ab94","1fb4c9d9d8be25deff8705335148c9f4f3937d34","6f90e519bb26af158a81ac0777fe4d12eb43fe2e","43aa8e0ea9fb20877a07e098d35e8ebcff0d0370","e6ba9e151974747b739b6cb6c3ce986d29e3fd04","3368bce3d896fef8f7a158d7bc6570fe8497bbd3","d7e6b9ad962eaa7ee057d7536a46c71400e94294","b3b1bbb9c3fbc8822dca79effd107ad2348b388c","44c13c53a41dbfab0a4b1a0cd214a6aa6bbdf986","36a779e64e43a05b9807f438cebae2f4f35e0e99","5bdcdfcf36d8d00e20c73028f2b9b827afd5b4e8","e692479dde357971a43a8429ef2f80f94c45a0cd","8cf632711fee6f2f572937ffaf64f7196dec0d4e","c2efe6a4679b995511fbba3106e67da98e178867","e27e830194b02a914847c2676089e2be638dea7a","7e1674fade5348d678cc754da9c6eb84a2d75e9c","9459f193d64f0e3394df43c6abc757fa922de9a2","7f1ed88dd881f595f79f2b740b52e3481216dddf","6f41e11e095ab774508428df54aa8b846750d10a"],"outCitations":["4c201c041c3eec1e2809f598d6817b17e80722ff","c0890ee109c664d897ceaf2ed21f343e9d90c811","58f44735f0e04875463e6b426ba94996001064ab","2e0d228e6b5d026831d00e8fd9159863b76c5007","276781ad19effd1d66d71bb47f3b48f09aed45c1","400866dbfb28243910c6db85767153c771e970cf","5ce9962e84955614a39030b4d49482d61d180cf1","3752b91aa590c58060554e2748830948aec1d16e","1cfafb5930ba2311cbe2f4386453eb8b79a7ca5e","bf925b8efe54c29654980ec94ec0e12492ba57b1","986056053e39cf7ed3f8cb9085044451eec5e310","7c6aaeb0e0e2e8f67911c7ac413770200f411a89","bfddf9eb9bddc0855a1353593020ea2e81133886","0f0054f5455f059fc87f9335af8ec495f9a5e11e","67d442b8abbf7f220e29d8d3dc0fceed065b472b","8a4e23963077d8709a003be75e01535f958bacbe","7d10551090e90a9525bceb7eb7d60d036d57f31d","b47434f835f426c04a3ac793400c0ea7ea44420d"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Medicine"],"year":2000,"venue":"Experimental eye research","journalName":"Experimental eye research","journalVolume":"70 6","journalPages":"\n          805-8\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1006\/EXER.2000.0845","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1006\/EXER.2000.0845","pmid":"10843785","magId":"2005667184"}
{"id":"6616f4ba272fcbf757b7f0626c6048c1ad145f4d","title":"Sex steroids and cardiovascular disease","paperAbstract":"As men grow older, testosterone (T) levels decline and the significance of this change is debated. The evidence supporting a causal role for lower circulating T, or its metabolites dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol, in the genesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men is limited. Observational studies associate low baseline T levels with carotid atherosclerosis, aortic and peripheral vascular disease, and with the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality. Studies using mass spectrometry suggest that when total T is assayed optimally, calculation of free T might not necessarily improve risk stratification. There is limited evidence to support an association of estradiol with CVD. Interventional studies of T therapy in men with coronary artery disease have shown beneficial effects on exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. However, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of T therapy in men with the prespecified outcomes of cardiovascular events or deaths are lacking. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of T published up to 2010 found no increase in cardiovascular events, mortality, or prostate cancer with therapy. Recently, in a trial of older men with mobility limitations, men randomized to receive a substantial dose of T reported cardiovascular adverse effects. This phenomenon was not reported from a comparable trial where men received a more conservative dose of T, suggesting a prudent approach should be adopted when considering therapy in frail older men with existing CVD. Adequately powered RCTs of T in middle-aged and older men are needed to clarify whether or not hormonal intervention would reduce the incidence of

{"id":"5802a5e1a6154c30f0dce033cb317c37ddd79dc2","title":"L\u2010tyrosine is the precursor of PQQ biosynthesis in Hyphomicrobium X","paperAbstract":"A method was developed to study amino acids as possible precursors of PQQ biosynthesis. Cultures of Hyphomicrobium X, growing on [13C]methanol, were supplemented with unlabelled amino acids. Uptake and participation in metabolism were determined via gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry of derivatized amino acids, obtained from hydrolysed cellular protein, by measuring their 12C content. Several amino acids appeared to be incorporated into the protein to a significant extent, without degradation or conversion. Among these were the aromatic amino acids, L\u2010tyrosine and L\u2010phenylalanine. Using the same replacement approach, their incorporation into PQQ was determined by 1H\u2010 and 13C\u2010NMR spectroscopy of purified PQQ obtained from the culture medium. It appeared that the complete carbon skeleton of tyrosine was present, forming the o\u2010quinone and pyrrole\u20102\u2010carboxylic acid moieties in PQQ, while phenylalanine was not incorporated at all. Starting with L\u2010tyrosine, possible biosynthetic routes to PQQ are discussed.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/5802a5e1a6154c30f0dce033cb317c37ddd79dc2","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"M A van Kleef","ids":["36077402"]},{"name":"J A Duine","ids":["4461542"]}],"inCitations":["b1015011a82cadab8992aebcde38c4af5094d1d8","4d67796916eeec7f916846403397683495bb89eb","89a46418ce88f4dfa2bc49f60afca1619515fc87","c7e5e5db90c0e2611d5afd29e91bf7236f7be4b0","68a59b2e9cf718fdfc09d088e7e04626f932d039","6a71024d914c7d700bda2c1da361b2ff3d512626","d12303a5b82d27a770bd8940c60c29e1941edb21","3a751fd1f51c2a4311be20c9c5c77b7131a63534","61d699c4a846627f6a6be6a2db4f03803fb3d431","14bb8f265b8b79c1b961e0327c93fac336b89160","25496ee236fcee21b1e434a9a754b5364bb05e48","aa9db6bc62a52d66d38866618e0b4acf561d55d4","0800a6c2384481aaf8442d01c9e119e8f3592a65","a8f600d2ccc4c7c353793ca1ca29be91d2313aef","549c77d755fed4bdf6c01f9a9e36fe00a2e794ce","86b3f60f11e4ad630b5595450ad267e7869a5e82","bc16ab42fe6c0e6ed06af32f372cfd4aeac195ae","f9ac580178469c986974bbca8c8b6a0d02e5359d","4a530156a3995648143a12e6b39b295d548106f7","efac9f9f52a24efe1d856ae9436ff7d04f26c905","fdc199beeb986777a98f41a01ed0f6e66d2c7070","b083444959c6c07cf2bc362eb5521f998e41e6f7","1e9b4142b5412086a07cbd6bd692d8d9f1cafa2f","08812e2c370e7efcd1a23b48811d58c710c3c2dc","cb9055e843b1246aec072760d7cb658f3a1bcfb3","9938c099b5ac0d2ab960dea2a3f0dd497fd2d8f9","035518caab99234269c31fb28a349f21618cfe5a","dafaa6eb84cfd1b6c2f49cfc8e980163659e88a0","3b524871bd60c629c489133b5b3e420877380cce","6ef8eefe02d5fc3c1ca4a8b9d3197a08fca61554","ec04394e3cdec91a80189157a0f000fe8fcf567f","37901188aada10671beffa1a1027d46c3d8d2063","4977cf9063f6456e648b7545c4de293b4c58cf28","308a281cac48b9c46a47eb8f38954e6be696c4bc","92c39994f81c759d50b8404666112d4d3eccc3ee","9017dce7476b31f9d03da5494f47dcb6f84411a3","047a5a47cc321dfa7d2378ff0d9bd3ea15089964","f172d0cb979c217c784201d05c3b1854530ca24d","d6e0cab66ab5db8db6342632bc6344dca5f579e7","3ca912304585d7109da835497014e7b0bf0645f1","730497ef892382404995a2f330b1f8990ed0ada1","bafa8903d31650440c9f7e184d818e445da30a01","ec2fa1b599eea052291f61fd05da70cce954774a","d0abb7bcab01780b443e26d6bebf6e95e180e3f7","bebe32964f7497d755b9aed0ad64d3e7cae2ccba","e06d124330e796c167ec366155121815d3da17c0","ecf586c3067869fadc64021d5192ee14e29b2e4e","b6eefdd0fa09600df236ede380ed5dfa52594e94","971da4d14bddc8ef547867fa9462c5b170a2b87e","edd9f5ed01508bb71401bbf472685746a99104d9","c9bd15c7eecdcdb0a3979c72b097894ea6424cd9","6cbb46a70550ddd6bad07aa1ea86d323b26ef080","28cee397857b3f34094729f63d1382b06b776da3","509de0ef6e7108d3e96e47a1172ba8c6465125dd"],"outCitations":["501e5b134756b4612dc443b5f62a16589d11acda","bed6be7738e35cdaecd7a0691f7011f5fa635ede","9e5178b6ae9e12dcd761d5b911840900b264d633","4050f58ff1b84d21e9a7ba44d4f94ca73ac61d22","5de051ab47800ad9c093643fe67f0ae8759bfede","0c988b9c5d7d44a49f5bc0b9a1d4591d9aa487a6","47b038def18d0921809d8c35f3d543d7b2aeefa2","402cf57ce2cdb2bd187dc4193e9cc3d054a606ff","0cd87b5267c00db3584246bb4c04f82415442f7b","744a6a322a256c56036f8db1790602207fb19a16","65ba150896edb38cb570fa4bee4bd59f624cab81","b314ce42a3f3a614ac76f0689f4f4282846ba2c2","bd3738ddcec749904f0c725b34877e4216bab034","be18d934fb4e7491cc1402e833b6d0f15c4d85f1","0dfbd24d25613a2911a2e0f2a5b75bd88501a5d7","31147f8b6e59a1237adb020f4e125d18e275c313","db6bf2bffa9eea83fc214ba46e0cd01dac29e5c1","aa5c1f1893714f89fb2367b944222e59e02a2bea"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine","Chemistry"],"year":1988,"venue":"FEBS letters","journalName":"FEBS Letters","journalVolume":"237","journalPages":"","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1016\/0014-5793(88)80178-9","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/0014-5793%2888%2980178-9","pmid":"2844590","magId":"1978820235"}

Quality soft shadows are closely related to the visibility computation. An accurate visibility information improves the shadows realism. However, this remains a challenging problem since even small visibility approximations can lead to unacceptable errors in a picture. We propose a new approach to this problem, based on an exact visibility pre-computation, done in the Plucker space. It takes advantage of this first step to provide an exact from-point visibility query algorithm. We propose several results in a ray tracing application, where the direct illumination at any given point is provided with a fast computation, and with a high degree of quality.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/3f5092b7baa2de931e26798c9f4f8b8c4088af10","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/doi.ieeecomputersociety.org\/10.1109\/CGI.2005.1500414","http:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Lilian_Aveneau\/publication\/4169637_Fast_and_exact_direct_illumination\/links\/02e7e523985ed19649000000.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Mora","ids":["144340922"]},{"name":"Lilian  Aveneau","ids":["1803366"]}],"inCitations":["38fd8aebdb7a946e04bd570de94831059a9250f2","6ec32d87d77ec7bc30630d8cdc7dbb864aae9129","d44ef580419c63d13deea1575598e99e89d50429","c9feedc4e1d5ec1940bec36d1415dfe3c2ff7b4f","685047354437e976ee0a4ca76abc764a9266b0b0","d8b51dbaeb422db1957b4ba29fa93d66c56cfde9","2216a84a161eefe523d31cf0fcab435bb07fb463","a383f15fb0dfff5d4ab09c6f511bc168ae1c814c","a2d9e138aba892f8573abf1c71e41aa99edbe53c","7cbe02c34d8fe9606765d849209bba2f4e6b15c3","0a8377ef9803fbfead4c11d9ed18699160b9cfcd","ec3522622b302a2792666e11379a6fc81a35c46b","0a15b2ec6318a6b827345bf8bff06677271dfc48"],"outCitations":["f922bf8411b00bce0bd97076196eedc3e529957b","7a72ed2d41950824ef09ad3541d0d25c62880eb5","4e37ffb8a5116b2c0eb203aef6ddfffebd3f3023","61c0af42dd4a53743d322dcca0c791529b31a0e3","2fb4120821ba407ef65f3c53237344a55e8ab0fa","e34db58050337bbcd1add8fdb3584a4358099e82","d88a806784846b326ddcc2de8c0a786d7ab9e6f0","8a035110cfc71ee03d7325d56fd4422caca48936","0706953b0eaca1c6db2160c05429376178172241","29d0183b651efcca4ad76e2492a8b8e65eeef76c","9b671a38982ae028544d1ff54baa09eedc23abaf","52ace250dbf4ca57c4d81c9b627bd221872ba9c2","9a3a478228d5cc2d05255fc41fdeabdb2a9aa8c9","47285988ff54b2cad2c0ce797bdc254940605903","339294a6753c514d145bc142e7921d04d045c935","32acb3168c3cd091ae8c80fab36f173e6b978e38","5196bc11ae524ff7902a77f7194220228c8a33be"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"year":2005,"venue":"International 2005 Computer Graphics","journalName":"International 2005 Computer Graphics","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"191-197","sources":["DBLP"],"doi":"10.1109\/CGI.2005.1500414","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1109\/CGI.2005.1500414","pmid":"","magId":"2176124024"}

This concerns the A function of the stimuli in the individual's motivational system. The second function of the stimuli in the motivational system, given to the stimuli as a result of the attitudinal function, is that the stimuli will serve as reinforcing stimuli for the individual. This concerns the R function of the motivational system. In addition to this, stimuli that have the A and the R functions will also have a third function for the individual. 'ouch stimuli will elicit (or control) behaviors. That is, as soon as a stimulus comes to elicit a positive emotional response through classical conditioning the stimulus will thereby acquire the power of controlling instrumental responses in the individual that approach the stimulus. The converse is true for negative A-R-D stimuli. The implications of this learning theory are elaborated in the context of presenting a theory of human motivation. The theory of human motivation is then employed to better understand a number of areas of importance to personality study, including an understanding of abnormal behavior in terms of the A-R-D (motivational) system and the present and potential roles of behavior therapy and behavior moJification in dealing with personality problems.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/45d06df57f7a79ff4256a9ac702301c41f0061eb","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/files.eric.ed.gov\/fulltext\/ED038013.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Staats","ids":["29936762"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["ee1aefdff9f902b7ee2a918b5fad96210dacb952","c55adf50a55aa56f0e07a18b68833a416ed31af8","aaf75443e0bcc6a7623e8b129bec2b1ba6c82c2b","e22fa9b4f7cc5115024b47e84d897478d33a9a4c","c0324a69842a6aa33a6b52b72c074110bb65980a","4dd299370586bfdb4c7798e4073be0b0bbb35d11","2fe2a1083fb615b8fc284dcedbc5cb0c2d57ba78","f8c7973660e11431f470ec275ba51856cc40ca9e","2baeb27551d806e36bc61012e25cfd428340458e","b684e9f6e08593b2634afc454041ebf37bf85008","4855572fcd6053a801075da81e166d6477aba280","8a7c55d65134f9167ec9ad33d008cd7266c35216","3e5d7b4e7d9674cd6913e38de3a71ee209e7eb41","36f1e2a97586246ac2f5fdb31e0f087554e7abd8","ea0027ee0a8afcd34eed5f16d34c663910b0e3e6","a5bca3e6a7fa2135e566f040926a9687cc3ae7f9","d1e9a66f13779aeeaacc5252dad62d08a752135d","5c5dada3a1b2f16430be33b9a6730492871ca203","e3880a998129ca1ff6f1c02c437801caabdbd5e8"],"fieldsOfStudy":[],"year":2007,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"10.21236\/ad0701412","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.21236\/ad0701412","pmid":"","magId":""}

The integration of information technology and learning has gone through the period from the use of information technology as a school\u2019s information literacy curriculum to the use of information technology as a learning tool to the use of information technology to create a learner-centred learning environment. Information technology and classroom integration are an important measure for teaching reform.

{"id":"7f488581d63f7cd4b916bab3705825afdcb3ea95","title":"Wind Stress and SST Variability in the North Atlantic Area: Observations and Five Coupled GCMs in Concert","paperAbstract":"Abstract Five coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere general circulation climate models and observations are compared with respect to their sea surface temperature (SST) and wind stress variability in the North Atlantic area, using 100 years of monthly means time series. Generalizations of the empirical orthogonal function and singular value decomposition techniques are described that circumvent the problem of the ambiguity of individual patterns inherent to eigenvalue methods. Using these generalized methods, a joint description of the air\u2013sea interaction up until interannual timescales is obtained for all models and observations simultaneously. This mean description explains a substantial fraction of the variance and the correlation of wind stress and SST in all models and the observations, thereby indicating a common basis for air\u2013sea interaction. It is in excellent agreement with previous observational studies.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/7f488581d63f7cd4b916bab3705825afdcb3ea95","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Jacob  Verbeek","ids":["145113721"]}],"inCitations":["d60bf1f91835fc6ddf82401821b871afb0d166ad","2354d5c66863dd950fb80c603b448d6779e81ff3","4eec6666228efc0869cd64a59075d34c173a693d","44dca578205c3f377159e41b35c654e734e8c434","1b110012f1fdca5f759f8db456394c459ed3077d"],"outCitations":["2eb0c00905547bb796d10dc967f3baae02bd90c4","4b5939e586305e10bacf8bd123020d616916935f","2272c4f695ec57590fb3bcf2a7ac1a622229a3c3","96f0b48690495ab5573e7392d4d18e0d92ffe5f3","3d4e6c1a04faec4ac1e24288d51f796a8c59f487","32fa5c4611d7d6c551abb7986a2b3f2af15d3989","0a29438599d72a5669b509d3965dadc7251f03c9","f2b15a0dde552d5931f5fc79c57cc29b56f69208","b70b653aa504d5c08bd04be4773fe5d658fdf276","87bdef59228d644f8e14bfe2578c68fef535438d","b8bc170d55785c2bc463d006c2f16e9cc470fdcc","ccafc5617d62bac8e05e8e5f8991c0f130fe8147","31036566b3b1a92fd2c72a4fdbc3ef452cd4d75d","89749d323f73f111861b4cf6e5d31a7d2ac2ecfe","3106d76f96f30c55f2fa1d7c4e09b2f0f11c3140","8a0cdb0c7ac2f6588af08ee046d882cc249c8c0b","d333c50227316570bf9660591201313274c0a3ba","68d8d0cb45f94beb4c91836853af25e4f559ff02","2dccd5d5d3ef4729bc0d9f6d0b067fd5ae1c7cf4","797bd6a09232dcb6bc14382c4f04dd52536379fb","b1239eed7ce8910559de948086a8a62f6263db8f","dcf406177c4f5d1fe8a9134ff818bc731532efc8","625f08dcb9d60dccd937d3569cf243db5157fb37","f2fb0848f627ca4292c2770fc1a089c042220eab","9bcbb62cf1fce8043b7882a8c9d5e3a57b4b103e","62c71cefee817d574846383f9fbdcae53437ba52","297a3d88f1b28201b58fb8b062d8c9ae1b7c5f8e","ad0e8bebd59ccd7b5701353bd8163e33d839f123"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Mathematics"],"year":1997,"venue":"","journalName":"Monthly Weather Review","journalVolume":"125","journalPages":"942-957","sources":[],"doi":"10.1175\/1520-0493(1997)125<0942:WSASVI>2.0.CO;2","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1175\/1520-0493%281997%29125%3C0942%3AWSASVI%3E2.0.CO%3B2","pmid":"","magId":"2165527793"}

The sensitivity of these strains to bacteriophages of Rhizobium loti, R. meliloti, R. galegae and R. leguminosarum was studied. Phages specific to R. loti strains were shown to induce the phage lysis of several Astragalus, Hedysarum and Ononis rhizobia. Ten R. loti strains tested for nodulation abilities on the plant hosts under investigation were able to develop nitrogen-fixing nodules on the Ononis arvensis roots. On the other hand, rhizobia from Ononis and Glycyrrhiza could form an effective symbiosis with Lotus corniculatus plants, so these bacteria are considered to belong to the Rhizobium loti taxon. Bacterial strains isolated from Astragalus and Hedysarum were observed to cross-nodulate their plant hosts as well as Oxytropis campestris, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Ononis arvensis plants, whereas they could not nodulate Lotus plants. It is concluded that these Rhizobium strains comprise a cross-inoculation group related to Rhizobium loti. ei]{gnR O D}{fnDixon}","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/f1eda2ef3b5eadf7cff770e7dfae5074345ccef3","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Natalie I.

Determinations of permeation and diffusion coefficient have been made by a very sensitive electrochemical method at room temperature, and in some cases with temperatures up to 80\u00b0C, for platinum, nickel, tantalum, titanium, zirconium, manganese, and iron-chromium alloys. The dependence of permeation at high cds on time varies qualitatively with the metal involved. The diffusion coefficient for iron-chromium alloys decreases with increasing chromium; the solubility increases with increasing chromium. In general, the solubility decreases with increasing heat of absorption, and decreases with decreasing d-vacancies. The diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing latent heat of sublimation of the metal. The critical concentration of hydrogen that causes embrittlement in the metal is interpreted in terms of a model involving the pressure of hydrogen in voids. Qualitative support is cited. Gas-phase heats of solution of hydrogen in metals are those obtained for the solution case. Solubility of hydrogen depends upon d-vacancies according to a simple model. A solution of equations relating to the diffusion of hydrogen out of pre-charged metal foils is given.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/c87e433d1fb793c9328750f90d9d735f85654ff5","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"J.

We find that the breaking stress, stretch modulus, and scission energy of the charged micelles are nonmonotonic functions of oppositely charged hydrotrope (NaSal) concentration. While the stretch modulus shows a peak at a value of surfactant-to-hydrotrope concentration ratio ( R) close to unity as expected due to neutralization of head-group charge at R = 1, the breaking stress and scission energy produce a peak at R < 1.0 because of thinning of the micelle diameter with increased R. The breaking stress from the simulations depends on the rate of deformation and roughly agrees with the experimental values of Rothstein ( J. Rheol. 2003 , 47 , 1227 ) after extrapolation to the much lower experimental rates. The method and results can be used to predict the effects of flow and mechanical stress on rates of micellar breakage, which is important in the rheology of wormlike micellar solutions.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/76e374daed0fc4ebd82023a7cae4d5ab1d64bf01","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Taraknath  Mandal","ids":["14018018"]},{"name":"Ronald G Larson","ids":["33593095"]}],"inCitations":["a74313382378c404ad24f30e1c0dbc76c433f973"],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Materials Science","Medicine"],"year":2018,"venue":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","journalName":"Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","journalVolume":"34 42","journalPages":"\n          12600-12608\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1021\/acs.langmuir.8b02421","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/acs.langmuir.8b02421","pmid":"30251869","magId":"2893498438"}

{"id":"fe5eb2ebaca3d58b6395b391b232c7e6ef5fa880","title":"Options and issues for pregnant adolescents.","paperAbstract":"\n Because of the increased rate of adolescent pregnancies, maternal-child nurses need to be aware of some of the special legal issues associated with pregnant adolescents. A pregnant adolescent has 4 options, each has legal implications. Abortion is a constitutionally protected right to privacy. However, state statutes vary in their treatment of adolescents seeking abortion. Parental notification may be required before an abortion can be performed. It is a nurse's obligation to be familiar with the state laws that apply to the adolescents they will encounter. It must be clearly understood that if the state has no parental involvement laws, it is a breach of patient confidentiality to notify parents. Retaining custody simply involves the mother keeping the child and raising it even though it is illegitimate. However, illegitimate children are today extended the rights and privileges of legitimate children e.g., inheritance, insurance benefits, and standing to sue in civil actions. Paternity can be either admitted to or demonstrated. Adoption laws vary tremendously by state, but they all function similarly in that the mother must sign away her right to custody. Some states allow for this to be revoked if the mother has somehow been forced or deceived into signing. Marriage is another option, however in most states the mother and father must be 18. In some states the age is 16 or 17 with parents' permission. In other states the couple can petition a judge for permission.\n","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/fe5eb2ebaca3d58b6395b391b232c7e6ef5fa880","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"A M Rhodes","ids":["7032655"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":1988,"venue":"MCN.

{"id":"d985d5a1ff66870f337d722c75fb68488cae6d05","title":"Cell cycle: A complex twist for BRCA2","paperAbstract":"BRCA2 is one of the best-known genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer, yet we know remarkably little about its role in the cell. Despite its large size (390 kDa), BRCA2 contains no obvious homology to known sequences \u2014 a fact that has eluded many previous attempts to characterize its function. It has been linked to both transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, but we still know relatively little about how loss of BRCA2 disrupts these processes. Now, reporting in Cell, Marmorstein and colleagues have isolated the multiprotein complex that BRCA2 resides in, and they show that it binds directly to a DNA-binding protein, BRCA2-associated factor 35 (BRAF35). What\u2019s more, they have identified a new function for BRCA2 \u2014 mediating timely progression into mitosis. To track down the elusive factors that interact with BRCA2, the authors used affinity purification. They found that BRCA2 is present in a 2 MDa complex. Within this complex, they identified BRAF35, an evolutionarily conserved protein that contains a high mobility group (HMG) domain. They then showed, using a pulldown assay, that BRCA2 and BRAF35 interact directly. Interestingly, BRAF35 is also present in a second complex that does not contain BRCA2. Because HMG domains are implicated in mediating binding at DNA junctions, they wondered whether BRAF35 might bind selectively to specific types of DNA. And they found, consistent with such a role, that BRAF35 is an architectural DNA-binding protein that binds cruciform DNA \u2014 the type of structure formed at junctions. Next, Marmostein and colleagues asked whether BRAF35 and BRCA2 are expressed together in vivo. Using in situ hybridization to mouse embryos, they found that both are expressed most highly in rapidly dividing cells. To look more closely at the subcellular localization, the authors examined mitotic HeLa cells using indirect immunofluorescence, and found that BRAF35 and BRCA2 both localize to mitotic chromosomes during initiation of chromosome condensation. This localization suggests a role for BRCA2 in cell-cycle progression \u2014 a function that they confirmed by antibodyinjection experiments. Here, injection of antibodies against either BRCA2 or BRAF35 resulted in a G2 delay in HeLa cells. So it seems that this complex might have a dual function in regulating both DNA repair and the cell cycle. Many questions have now been raised. For instance, can this complex bind to the DNA junctions that are formed during DNA repair? Does BRAF35 mediate interaction of BRCA2 with DNA for all BRCA2\u2019s functions? Now that the identity of BRCA2\u2019s cohorts has been unveiled, the answers to these questions are likely to come pouring in.

Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) have been applied to the profiles from each technique both separately and in combination. These techniques complement each other and enable a clearer picture of the biological samples to be interpreted not only for classification purposes, but also more importantly to define the metabolic state of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. The results showed at least 24 metabolites that were significantly modified in the group of atherosclerotic patients by this nontargeted procedure. Most of the changes can be associated to alterations of the metabolism characteristics of insulin resistance that can be strongly related to the metabolic syndrome. In addition, correlations among variables accounting for the classification show amino acids as variables whose changes showed a high degree of correlation. GC-MS and (1)H NMR fingerprints can provide complementary information in the identification of altered metabolic pathways in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. Moreover, correlations among the results with both techniques, instead of a single study, can provide a deeper insight into the patient state.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/e15125d949a53830f8832d4734f1347535f1c6f8","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Joanna  Teul","ids":["5784360"]},{"name":"Francisco J Rup\u00e9rez","ids":["3498114"]},{"name":"Antonia  Garcia","ids":["145035655"]},{"name":"Julie  Vaysse","ids":["40570736"]},{"name":"St\u00e9phane  Balayssac","ids":["47718376"]},{"name":"V\u00e9ronique  Gilard","ids":["5437935"]},{"name":"Myriam  Malet-Martino","ids":["1397690096"]},{"name":"Jose Luis Martin-Ventura","ids":["1398312142"]},{"name":"Luis Miguel Blanco-Colio","ids":["1398189347"]},{"name":"Jos\u00e9  Tu\u00f1\u00f3n","ids":["145909929"]},{"name":"Jes\u00fas  Egido","ids":["143778845"]},{"name":"Coral  Barbas","ids":["2647254"]}],"inCitations":["68fe42ecff623ac3a4d259836fb9ad62fd29111b","4f8dc82abb2d5fa8b661015c8d86782fa93bfac3","47eceeebc147d836a839d95a04c4e580e7dc398c","d15c0e90f72d7fa1b27ed2d93ac0298277b5ca89","316a92a039644e9c9e50d26952479d1d0002e8b1","0b53977deb6b631c68596e0e28c242e4a99fc265","25616c50f11b373248b13265cc9769228d5346fc","386c1538830e5df075b600f3c96a4767412ab88c","e790d65d1e2fdf961bfccb07ba7584f82eb088c0","e068e936a837af32e93a03f9731313460ffcf30f","209b92c22787b14c761f700f3958a9c084c76b5d","dd6c3fd66d1caef1be6a038a96dc3bb7f5b8efad","d196e97a169a641ed36e540beda31d6d506ad410","92c5f39f58bcb035271d310f00ef60f8364c7b3f","b182b2db5d3dbfb9bfb599b3e96409704bfe3648","17334bcf835430ae67d3fcdd4866d2cf08638ac1","d4686227641b120ada999802ee8897b5d9a79180","f17024042906a51a8d993783360bbc1852823f22","2de71f688038098b0c2ce4724adeff047f0248c1","492b9cb4798dac2bc1882e33535ae9ed117a37ba","8f679a7ce999d480b8aa173d9cc19a7276314d34","278e01f8f17d6fa020dc27b74529cbecc0c27eb5","0ea5d0da4e6c6bfb2a9024e89b42366756fb993f","db813ce89935d42fd8d84305ca07b5ddbad47c85","4248ab96098c59741dcd884546afc07f45bc109b","c7aa61b041d51e54b10a4f79fabe8e3ac6df4131","9aa563edb570825e0c304ca5486b6edffa282fa3","53a4ab8107ea6c3cbc39a229f3b0024a3098ca93","3aaf2f4df1ade94452fee48a672beef4023e2006","0ba1acf58ab0cea46aa7cc166ba9f0254215e6cc","d7da238c9c94933487ca2dc688304dc252018cdb","5fd769de648979c775c805112d8bd7e9f2782286","347163eedbb9bd9aee6d356ce285f4f6ce028136","9c4b15a71376499e7ef6659db88ac0cac3307bd5","3bfbc18be426cb9dae076e8a99477a5e557fc911","24cb2123b5d0a33cf1415b2380c13ef856c46f45","d3919fd1f65e7e16181014d648d487b000a25bd8","5051a18b7a2d2dba18f0a4b6abea753159d73b51","ebdafe1458c6fb83ca817b675aae07f9558ae6fa","b355fa70bc54dc76f0920667e4b9ab512695675a","8b8a02b9878c951a772e1e7ab1315217b5143a13","8b7923f76206373d3ce32152ca7729026220f8c1","7e914218d973e9ab5ba522d89b67c30b73ed4208","073723df9afb5d051aec319b826b241b02332868","d18cab9ab9455412e7366e63f668e3fbd8cc129d","f2926c5ba5dc4aca82fdbbb1b5166bb29696f4ca","2db9826a10a09cbbfd93ec671592ab8af7e8c768","e08b41ab31fbfa60af87902ad519878329d5c559","9d16daaef18bb46f95760fb6829ddfb16307adbe","e95d1fef907295aa01ae98d403c14395bf4b1284","938704d1c1a3919ef26ca3dbb413423940cafb08","8eda08b7bc7e9c80e69f4cb13eab73e80812ef30","2af0b31a2c304f82bc31ec3770e4ae60bab1e6b3","c9e60eabf0531e03be6736c5cdd2fdde2364f962","3b64d0278668ba13e829928e98dfe4acbc50e995","14892686666a2388cb2b5bb056fe6c092a15eb07","decb98a84e48162c32060015652e9a576f3c55b8","f9f64825e1fe173b230dabcb0516a79679f14745","b37a7c7c059247c84fd3ee4a0e61be091ee62823","a17d5d32735cda8d1a9ecf2a17a6c62ab632d0c5","3ec4bee2d6e802eb8b9f99204bc8570615ee1a45","d28f9ca741e59613293887b5770f3179b71dfca9","10cece5d2dc81ad85f4664e9cb4468a329c259b6","dd9786863c7517ed0c34922d67f090f2c2fc43f6","ee00eae0d5e08dfccc1290ac4b96555a11944aa4"],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Medicine"],"year":2009,"venue":"Journal of proteome research","journalName":"Journal of proteome research","journalVolume":"8 12","journalPages":"\n          5580-9\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1021\/pr900668v","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1021\/pr900668v","pmid":"19813770","magId":"2094210555"}

If AUR is caused by increased sympathetic activity at the level of the prostatic smooth muscles, alpha-blockers (alpha-1 adrenoreceptor antagonists) should increase the likelihood of a successful trial without catheter (TWOC) following AUR. Alpha-blockers effectively reduce the symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and improve the urodynamic parameters of obstruction. They may diminish the incidence of AUR and the need for prostatectomy in symptomatic men.

The software implementation is packaged as network service where it is broadcasted from an access point connecting to a designated server. With the established network connection, mobile phones users can receive services semi-ubiquitously within the range of the broadcast. This architecture resolves the issue of heterogeneity of computational capacity among different types of mobile phones. As an on-going project, future studies will focus on the usability and designs with an attempt to enhance the efficacy of the application.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/d8b436c1abf939b8eebea31410681db983c541d7","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Yuan Xun Gu","ids":["21506957"]},{"name":"Nai  Li","ids":["2755272"]},{"name":"Leanne  Chang","ids":["2652175"]},{"name":"Henry Been-Lirn Duh","ids":["1679875"]}],"inCitations":["36614c2e679e7e00c63ce4995aefd615aeb65cb7"],"outCitations":["358ba8e4530c8abf71eee8c77afcaac2011ecbd4","d0789e93482455ae5f1e5d4ef3d6bb51b9ce2e38","32ccdd9e24775d5f20430ef44fefad7a2efc0610","d1baa7bf1dd81422c86954447b8ad570539f93be","772b86fbcf43767852d7d793c70b4864a49aba2d","c56185fc68762fbdec520206bc66cd0067f1a8a9","e3a671da45697ab23a03f6625d6cfa773776968b","baaebf6335d05dd95e4bf732baf0066f901b9dc2","caf574379caefa3ff3b16343aff43cb3c35d5a53","fa098415bb87a3868f74f706ce25eebc622a851a","6cfa6eaa18439366325700c445d2f4948d9d4728","3c90b7ac9b3ef9701d071631a6135a5e922c658f","b1493085f7206d8d7ccf2b21ca3ac7a5c16a917a","5bd61a214c65607ff5a44f742e22b6ea61a77e0a","0103e35b09c60e37aee1291c52f5f347401c6f02","c519ef1e9b8df340e3bde7c2b5a6b00a7dbccee2","28106810aebe2c6131ad9e7895e967e2424c307f"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Engineering"],"year":2011,"venue":"","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"117-126","sources":[],"doi":"10.1007\/978-1-4419-9845-3_9","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/978-1-4419-9845-3_9","pmid":"","magId":"2152691722"}

Universidad de las Ciencias Inform\u00e1ticas, Cuba. yvm@uci.cu. Abstract. A continuous curve in 2, 3, or higher dimensions, can be thought as a path of a continuously moving point. This class of curves has been used in the design and implementation of spatial data structures. This paper is essentially focused on the efficient representation of terrain models. We propose to implement a binary triangles tree by means of the Sierpinski space-filling curve. The hierarchical nature of this curve makes it very useful to represent this kind of spatial structure. Traversal algorithms, neighbor finding techniques, among others, are presented on the paper demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed structure.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/f43870f49813861b66f44b12b7735984e2a34d5b","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/papers.cumincad.org\/data\/works\/att\/sigradi2009_979.content.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Yusnier  Mart\u00ednez","ids":["116368984"]},{"name":"F.

People with this disorder have an ongoing loss of cells (atrophy) in the retina, which is the specialized lightsensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye, and in a nearby tissue layer called the choroid. During childhood, they begin experiencing nearsightedness (myopia), difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision. Over time, their field of vision continues to narrow, resulting in tunnel vision. Many people with gyrate atrophy also develop clouding of the lens of the eyes (cataracts). These progressive vision changes lead to blindness by about the age of 50.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/a5a8126879d1bd2323fbc51b15ea525a919c2099","pdfUrls":["https:\/\/ghr.nlm.nih.gov\/condition\/gyrate-atrophy-of-the-choroid-and-retina.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"J  Fran\u00e7ois","ids":["145246312"]}],"inCitations":["8fcb47ab20403da3294c1518c6353de86bd993b6"],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":1979,"venue":"Bulletin de la Societe belge d'ophtalmologie","journalName":"Bulletin de la Societe belge d'ophtalmologie","journalVolume":"185","journalPages":"\n          55-66\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"540192","magId":"2412706277"}

This paper proposes a solution of Chinese chunking with another type of spec, which is not derived from a complete syntactic tree but only based on the un-bracketed, POS tagged corpus. With this spec, a chunked data is built and HMM is used to build the chunker. TBLbased error correction is used to further improve chunking performance. The average chunk length is about 1.38 tokens, F measure of chunking achieves 91.13%, labeling accuracy alone achieves 99.80% and the ratio of crossing brackets is 2.87%. We also find that the hardest point of Chinese chunking is to identify the chunking boundary inside noun-noun sequences1.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/ae06924c728fca52d29561a61eede8d6efd36362","pdfUrls":["http:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/aclweb.org\/anthology-new\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/aclweb.org\/anthology\/W04-1107","http:\/\/aclweb.org\/anthology\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/acl.ldc.upenn.edu\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","https:\/\/aclweb.org\/anthology\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/anthology.aclweb.org\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/wing.comp.nus.edu.sg\/~antho\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology-new\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","http:\/\/aclweb.org\/anthology\/\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf","https:\/\/www.aclweb.org\/anthology\/W04-1107\/","http:\/\/newdesign.aclweb.org\/anthology-new\/W\/W04\/W04-1107.pdf"],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Hongqiao  Li","ids":["2910445"]},{"name":"Changning  Huang","ids":["2227579"]},{"name":"Jianfeng  Gao","ids":["1800422"]},{"name":"Xiaozhong  Fan","ids":["3325677"]}],"inCitations":["0819297ca736e790d31de8af416b9db62e12f1e1","a516a2b6ec49b241db88ba04bd21a6f609f3cdcb","7e58e40f80e57e306b0d7ec81924f2021cf72d71","f80c55eb59c946f73b65f74b793facfb8190ae6f","97158d6598b5e6ae12576b879bc73e0dadf40d90","dd683d45c60662c67741b0f10ce199394eedc0da","dab19bada76287519e08866cb1934160f547387c","6d8a1ca1c3317f53445e5c2692f8ef7892a357a4","df234c29fd1ce1e9fd8af36d440960f6de6b0a72","fd76e062d57ce1da54f9372136989d10fade8b35","995d2bd2de42254c1b28136f1c9d50ab7030e69d","3dc553a24585dd1031341ef6264f01a96f9e8699","fd8d20b80a8e82c9bb97d7bffa87ffb6b239bf92","681aa30b8a537691750a704c621ef915dfc0b513","5af5b02fbcf56c1c1b32c66acbf30172a19ea43d","3a661d6b73b5ea8bdac04f7fea7a78d06f4ce0d8","5f455a2fc81367716e449e06b63628fa1f66b965","d6ec3b5aec9ed07c4c59445628cb0ca54a971714","e21ada3c1cafe857c249c2578257309fab614c6c","3c618caffcf4af3b8f41811d3aa6ffae0e13aaac","889db78a0e07a9add5870de7fbf09e078f84f0b1","26997ad426f57e98e274072b56d7c8e07ee541df","0b514af7647f1bd47e9ac3afeea315281da096ad"],"outCitations":["0853a6724aec7814057be29f75b9fe56f3763d07","b6d37f00d6bdca945483eea2fdb2b1b1510d0b17","2b2eb4a9bb146e3ffaa0b025fba0ed14240c683f","a7fd9d1327625f1213f60d20da691596a7b18789","d9c71db75046473f0e3d3229950d7c84c09afd5e","6dab18a84d4c01b8174d09f4537548e16d08ddfa","fefaff76e608343fa13b756255276f713cd42517","d358484c093619d2babb52069d0118c6c87fd78e","5babc27a99824dc003c9c92f60e459437bc95bff","923db0aeb26a6dc1cb42069c9db04e5dd2d2200a","3430d81b966bad129026c31d1dba4069c89628a5","593755226b85179aca7a0f6154eeb9ca8246ed84","56d7826f3afaa374077f87ca3529709b1ca7e044","cb352f6df85ada5f90ab0301e3bdbf37c93b3190","9e85832b04cc3700c2c26d6ba93fdeae39cac04a","04e9131112c50379c8cf77609b72e3bcc73af957","8a601640a709eb96e65d130ef8aac69e9ea3602d","e855488e9c22200991322186e38e2c7321f7f5d1","0f107d947cc032a6fedba5470d965b7aaa261eaa","a3c11b10ee57313c37c93bb62d669f01894ae768"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"year":2004,"venue":"SIGHAN@ACL","journalName":"","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":["DBLP"],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"163491668"}

The giant cell tumour (GCT) is a benign locally aggressive neoplasm located near the articular end of tubular bones. Both lesions are characterised histologically by multinucleated giant cells in a background of ovoid to spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells. There is a basic question whether both lesions are separate entities or variants of the same disease. The study of cell cycle-associated proteins may give insights into clarifying such question. The expression of these proteins is also important to determine the cell cycle regulation in both tumours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, Ki-67 and PCNA in CGCG and GCT. The results demonstrated that, despite the lack of p53 immunoreactivity, all the samples showed wide expression of MDM2. The percentage of Ki-67- and PCNA-positive cells in CGCG was statistically higher than that of GCT Our findings show that CGCG has a higher proliferative activity compared with that of the GCT. Our results also suggest that p53 inactivation by MDM2 expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of giant cell lesions of the jaws and long

The thinking of designing spatial E-R model based on geographic ontology as semantic foundation is presented. And a method of establishing conceptual model of spatial database by designing spatial E-R model from geographic ontology is introduced with an example about irrigation ontology represented by expanded OWL.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/ed944bece6ac8856eb58919babc37ae35c041a81","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Zhou  Danhui","ids":["71968051"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"],"year":2007,"venue":"","journalName":"Computer Engineering","journalVolume":"","journalPages":"","sources":[],"doi":"","doiUrl":"","pmid":"","magId":"2375871928"}

To obtain objective estimates of ciliary beat frequency from video-image sequences, a computer-based method was developed. Regions of interest of video-image sequences were selected and digitized. Variations in numerical values representing light intensity resulting from cilia beating were extracted and analyzed using autocorrelation techniques. The ciliary beat frequencies obtained for 14 in vitro experiments on ciliated cells or epithelium from the frog palate (Rana catesbeiana) over the range of frequencies 2-25 Hz correlated well with independent observer measurements (r = 0.979). The addition of such computer-based methods to video observer-based systems allows more objective and efficient determinations of ciliary beat frequency.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/713042104e391d40d5e910ec29c5db4110826ac5","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"S J Hennessy","ids":["144646383"]},{"name":"L B Wong","ids":["13760681"]},{"name":"D B Yeates","ids":["30321394"]},{"name":"I F Miller","ids":["1968132"]}],"inCitations":["c95e25a6ae48cabdee54c44a67b98b97bfbfd759","0368ae28c8f71cf8a66b7b670e3e3bd585ca6ec7","f6ea83635e2d47fea50ba5b7f900a55f7f4436ae","5efab360623491a4e341257a74b5f40ff38af396","f692378f121e8b7ca86ec9b2a00d2a71c2205a0b","92eadc23b617d1e5b0798c496ea8cbf510c29116","f6eac9b959a9368df051b345857dff5f94acaf3a","acc2dbbb68492bb434cfd5d4df5095619f33943b","27a1e8e0eafcc525bcb31cb7ca85a456eb3ec467","2fa0424889a341accca5f7ed05722573246517c6","3094b8ebc55b56ce4c3d8b6219d575b0391d13a7","ea39b8294982c79b1e0ddf2ae67407740e8d9666","dce54cd85a0657cb866026025d7f54c078be8fd3","6918d8c881201bc54c900f27912fc93ee35317a3","74d2c26a3e734e14de58cfa3048b5706c87f9a4b"],"outCitations":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Biology","Medicine"],"year":1986,"venue":"Journal of applied physiology","journalName":"Journal of applied physiology","journalVolume":"60 6","journalPages":"\n          2109-13\n        ","sources":["Medline"],"doi":"10.1152\/JAPPL.1986.60.6.2109","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1152\/JAPPL.1986.60.6.2109","pmid":"3487539","magId":"2282838259"}
{"id":"15bdef5b0f937c44a6a01bfa9f2fd8cbfbf19f65","title":"HCC: Where Does HCV Therapy Play a Role?","paperAbstract":"Viral infections have the potential to induce carcinogenesis through chronic inflammation. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C (HCV) are two major risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are responsible for 70\u201380\u00a0% of cases seen worldwide. The incidence of HCC has been rising in the USA over the last several decades, largely in part to the prevalence of HCV-induced cirrhosis. Curative therapies with resection and orthotopic liver transplantation are only available for individuals with early-stage HCC, and disease recurrence is still common after treatment, highlighting the need for both primary and secondary preventative measures. Despite the low rates of viral eradication with interferon-based regimens, many studies have shown a chemo-protective effect in patients who do achieve a sustained virologic response. The emergence of new direct-acting antiviral agents with cure rates above 95\u00a0% has the potential to change the landscape of HCV-induced HCC. This article discusses the current data for HCV therapy as a chemo-preventive agent and HCV treatment strategies for patients with various stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.","entities":[],"s2Url":"https:\/\/semanticscholar.org\/paper\/15bdef5b0f937c44a6a01bfa9f2fd8cbfbf19f65","pdfUrls":[],"s2PdfUrl":"","authors":[{"name":"Stacey  Prenner","ids":["38639908"]},{"name":"Laura  Kulik","ids":["31578098"]}],"inCitations":[],"outCitations":["2e90f8cdbacf013ffb8232751ee96dd66ddbab7f","adb9ab2333ae25f09f64a8e681bed6088502113d","5eb19a25b8da833e1c07449d5738c0348c458051","7f05abf4bde0db12149e51cd854a22c81db3fa86","12034c9b0c74feff6b11036f9bfca09944450fc6","b56e68d7beeb799b2369878d854464a2d3b53834","d07d1d40bcbea87f41cd9df69af6a9571837a678","0ba4268ba385e10f7f2d29a2730a5a68806ef5f3","46fef05ce565c947862377ff3d26020a6dfc4fd4","173e860e267d24edb26451fc1e200be91664a2eb","a3d33beb43c5b23fb05a9fb1620eeeaac51deeec","57d2b3ebe882a84e692f5cd4636ee0439d0ea351","f88b0eac9c4cf6ff0eb3dfbe0c8f3fdb383bdf69","94bdcdb2545b006288494f048f749028ba8b8a74","a1c8e7a498e456305b2df4525e68a568c6215ece","5f6002e4d3c7c5adab0db4b7edf31af4147ca811","1008919df3180e3b07bc941bd241a3173c4d159d","e8d2debbe30c81ec5ddebefb520f584d283246bc","09e7c96249eb3980a373ec817ff48a333dd9b959","be678e145b1256e4e9dc2b906fdc0d76276f125e","064fe383503bfeb68dee72d1320ba5f025eedba9","d4a57127aeaff935854bc60216d83acac0ee0507","8f0150bf72261bde216e8d4544b094cc5f9fadd4","44c1a74e1d1ff8cd6ad2cc11507d56d6a78de7bc","688515d7c1f9870ae235607bf32b45ae8a1a5bcf","3868ce79897f8dd1268a271a29ba0cba3b514392","e34850a97f4fe78a9422d2d6c206cce8957ac771","8c80667424b2df651db04be6790261b7dfd76cfd","6ac248bd6e2dab9e49821ac57d11d042261582e6","d333b0d76d9a42a91744ec01768d89862b8a06ad","01595f11a0adf08d9454567c3720543fd53fb556","01a8a88fd0a01bacfd276e1789accfd413921ebb","ec2f0239600cc8c01cb1b46122c5985cee9b235c","b61d365792f6d5b46cf01f4857f233f4e501e580","e0d132b3f520a83430008806102352c4c78e7175","e83f105457520e9d751a692985c638257ba85ee2","c3fb8f00ca368949e9e3bc0d72ea7da9378adb09","33529df23d85e41d37bc1d35923c2e4ea66373e9","7f5cf0bf1a1b51c5d6f9b64881d7a308a96f581b","ccb7319ecc636b85cad66df066da32ad3d3f5211","9e730b78d74690e4fbc2a93a91845994833d3a46","fa24c603ec3070082f074b91140ca28fa1f051ec","40c3638b41e8ffeb596037cc04f006bfdb2b7d0d","325ae9ef73ff552b41fbe3f1af6cf7d691e7c8f2","780a2d3807f3aec1eecbcb84848c48c24badee9a","243975c18e825acbb971bb37919609646d323e26","e06f75c8a9a8ec2ad899c1bb61a3f2afe564fc33","183a2a192ae59fb40b3349ffa949dd58e8beaf15","4f044251e1d5407f88fb990cf1d82d16ba4b2742","081efed75e0ba3774a6b647b01b8a5422624eb08","fa29a22e0410d159ecfbcb1396399f2747e66f16","0131a9fe5cc94f4ae78d359c020afdef521cb76d","4d59826030a367b45c30aa8ef5875d60e7fb3ef8","2bf24e9497f4f3a26f93f258498b982b9fa55c64","7bc9ca216cd9f8ba800c32da8d14febee33cfdfe","1e77aabc5f4f3a0df37c5c628f851e2126f5cba9","d35b8ad886342d4909f0789745af84fc6e31443c","85e5c0086a344814879278a398ecf054ff60fa3c","70d2185fa72e9f6bef081f85f6f2fb32a7745f63","bf7a2caf823a241523a24dd7e892db2edef96b6b","d9aabb916114b7bf04504733ec37390bab76b717","299efb4361d107b3878c9fce50b8a87203e2fcff","0c76e762fa0c0e6d72de55bcffe79359fa4992b1","0779a119f1b455e595994452da33005e4461871c","3a2a5bf70064574704e66373c60c8f27cd4eca80","cfb6e9bce8394fe5468f457361a74d5e2c6a5462","cfc455ac8f1713a268cde8b79a081edd6f2daf10","68e194603c38a443d808061d7cdc72ab1c069189","2098043e0c0f1b77ab631d2de644f1945cac8bd0","2d0f8151caa8ec391c149a3f9034914ed4deba66","195b10659be7981f71d723c9c3b7bf180a54588d","2a1f8fe987fcd429b6c4f7b88df75a9a80fc7cfe","50e76df7676081a25d6bf0da6d7ad3a38488da2e","8f112289decb1824e579e287e73c10db3af59b65","04907c7d0b2f8dee4cba50b10efc83d8caec8ee5","c1727f99c93f3f92591b8c181f3aa34a2dc55dcd"],"fieldsOfStudy":["Medicine"],"year":2016,"venue":"Current Hepatology Reports","journalName":"Current Hepatology Reports","journalVolume":"15","journalPages":"17-25","sources":[],"doi":"10.1007\/s11901-016-0292-z","doiUrl":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/s11901-016-0292-z","pmid":"","magId":"2277323606"}
